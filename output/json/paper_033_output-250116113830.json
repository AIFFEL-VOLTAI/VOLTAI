The images show that both pristine and coated samples maintain a similar spherical morphology with diameters ranging from 5 to 15 µm. These secondary particles consist of submicron and nanosized primary particles. Additionally, EDX mappings (Figure 2d-g) confirm an even distribution of aluminum, indicating a uniform and conformal coating of Al2O3 on the NCM surface.",
        "Explanation of TEM results": "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis, as mentioned in the document, confirms the homogeneous coating of the NCM particles with an amorphous Al2O3 layer approximately 6 nm thick. This indicates that the coating process does not significantly alter the particle morphology or structure."
