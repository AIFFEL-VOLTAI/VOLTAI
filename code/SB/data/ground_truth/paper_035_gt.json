The agglomerates are about 20 μm in size and are formed by clusters of crystallites that are about 0.3-0.5 μm in size. The intercrystallite space is partly accessible to the liquid electrolyte and partly supplies lithium ions to the crystallites in the solid phase. The S1bare sample shows inclusions of irregular shape and widely varying sizes on the agglomerates surface, which are likely LiOH and Li2CO3. The washed and coated samples have fewer of these inclusions.",
