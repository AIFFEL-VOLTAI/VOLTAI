add_qustion:
List all discharge capacities (mAh/g) at different conditions (e.g., initial capacity, after cycling, different C-rates, cutoff voltages). Include the electrode state and any specified conditions such as current density, cycling stage, or voltage range.
List all discharge capacities (mAh/g) for pristine, doped, and coated electrodes at all specified C-rates (e.g., 0.1C, 5.0C). Include electrode state (e.g., pristine, doped, coated) and any relevant conditions or performance metrics.

example:
- Cathode Performance:
    Capacity at all C-rate, mAh/g (with electrode state):
      - 200.2 mAh/g: "@0.1C, Pristine"
      - 191.3 mAh/g: "@0.5C, Pristine"
      - 214.5 mAh/g: "@0.1C, ZrO2-coated"
      - 200.8 mAh/g: "@0.5C, ZrO2-coated"
    Voltage range: "2.8–4.3 V"
    Temperature: "Room temperature and 55°C"
