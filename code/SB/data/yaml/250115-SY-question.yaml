  Provide a detailed explanation of the SEM and TEM results, ensuring all relevant information is included even if dispersed across multiple sections or chunks. Mention particle morphology, size, or any other characteristics noted in the results.

add_question4: |
  List all discharge capacities (mAh/g) at different conditions (e.g., initial capacity, after cycling, different C-rates, cutoff voltages). Include the electrode state and any specified conditions such as current density, cycling stage, or voltage range.
  List all discharge capacities (mAh/g) for pristine, doped, and coated electrodes at all specified C-rates (e.g., 0.1C, 5.0C). Include electrode state (e.g., pristine, doped, coated) and any relevant conditions or performance metrics.
