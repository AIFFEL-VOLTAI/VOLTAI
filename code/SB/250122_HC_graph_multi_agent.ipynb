In recent years, it has\\\\nbeen demonstrated that high-Ni LiNixCoyMnzO2 (x ≫ 1/3)\\\\nallow for much higher degrees of delithiation, and therefore\\\\nspeciﬁc capacities in excess of 150 mAh/g. 10 Nevertheless,\\\\nincreasing the Ni content is associated with a decrease in\\\\ncapacity retention, which is a major drawback so far.11 Part of\\\\nthe reason for this is the fact that Ni-rich materials suﬀer from\\\\nlarger volumetric changes with delithiation, leading to more\\\\nsevere degradation and mechanical failure.10,12−15 Besides,\\\\nincreasing the Ni content results in increased surface reactivity\\\\n(electrolyte decomposition).16−18\\\\nAnother strategy to improve the energy density is to increase\\\\nthe charge cutoﬀ voltage to over 4.3 V vs Li. For the sake of\\\\nclarity, all voltages are given with respect to Li/Li + in the\\\\nfollowing (note that the voltage diﬀerence among cells using\\\\ngraphite [full-cell geometry] and lithium metal anodes [half-cell\\\\ngeometry] is around−100 mV). As an example, NCM111 has\\\\nbeen reported to deliver a speciﬁc capacity of about 200 mAh/g\\\\nin the voltage range from 2.5 to 4.6 V.2 However, charging\\\\nNCM cathode materials to higher states of charge (SOC) is\\\\naccompanied by more pronounced changes in lattice\\\\nstructure.10,13,19\\\\nFrom both industrial and scienti ﬁc points of view, the\\\\nquestion what cathode composition and voltage range provides\\\\nthe optimum in terms of energy density, costs, stability and\\\\nsafety is yet to be answered. For automotive applications, in\\\\nparticular, energy density is one of the most important\\\\nparameters. In literature, electrode materials for LIBs are\\\\noften benchmarked for a given voltage range or degree of\\\\n(de)lithiation. For example, Ishidzu et al. studied and compared\\\\nthe volume changes of NCMs of diﬀerent composition in the\\\\nvoltage range of 2.5−4.5 V.13 Nevertheless, from a techno-\\\\nlogical point of view, the mere evaluation of, e.g., cycling\\\\nstability for a given maximum cell voltage may not be suﬃcient.\\\\nCells using low-Ni NCMs typically last signiﬁcantly longer than\\\\nhigh-Ni NCM-based cells when operated in the same voltage\\\\nrange. However, for the latter, a signiﬁcantly lower maximum\\\\ncell voltage would be required for achieving similar energy\\\\ndensities.\\\\nIn this work, we show that NCM111 and NCM811 cells\\\\nprovide virtually the same energy density at 4.6 and 4.3 V,\\\\nrespectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is very\\\\nimportant to analyze both the performance and structural\\\\ndegradation of diﬀerent Ni content NCM cathodes for a given\\\\nenergy level rather than voltage range in a reference-type LIB.\\\\nTo allow for a reasonable performance assessment, we estimate\\\\nthe energy densities as a function ofUmax for a variety of NCMs\\\\nand correlate the results with structural properties of the\\\\nmaterials from operando X-ray diﬀraction.\\\\n■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\\\\nLi1.02NixMnyCozO2 (x + y + z = 1) cathode materials withx:y:z\\\\n= 1:1:1 (NCM111), 5:2:3 (NCM523), 6:2:2 (NCM622), 7:2:1\\\\n(NCM721), 8:1:1 (NCM811) and 85:10:5 (NCM851005)\\\\nwere obtained from BASF SE (Ludwigshafen, Germany). All\\\\nelectrodes were prepared by slurry casting onto Al foil using a\\\\nKTF-S roll-to-roll coater (Mathis AG). For NCM622,\\\\nNCM721, NCM811 and NCM851005, slurries were obtained\\\\nby dispersing cathode material (94 wt %), Super C65 (1 wt %,\\\\nTimcal) and SFG6L (2 wt %, Timcal) conductive carbon\\\\nadditives as well as Solef 5130 PVDF binder (3 wt %, Solvay) in\\\\n1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NEP). For NCM111 and NCM523,\\\\nslurries were obtained by dispersing cathode material (93 wt\\\\n%), Super C65 (1.5 wt %) and SFG6L (2.5 wt %) conductive\\\\ncarbon additives as well as Solef 5130 PVDF binder (3 wt %) in\\\\nNEP.\\\\nElectrochemical characterization was conducted at 25°Co n\\\\ncoin-type cells. The cells were assembled inside an Ar-ﬁlled\\\\nglovebox (MBraun) by stacking cathode, glass micro ﬁber\\\\nseparator (GF/D, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Whatman) and\\\\nlithium foil anode (Albemarle Germany GmbH) of diameters\\\\n13, 17, and 13 mm, respectively, using 250μL of either LP30 (1\\\\nM LiPF6 in a 1:1 [wt/wt] mixture of ethylene carbonate and\\\\ndimethyl carbonate) or LP47 (1 M LiPF6 in a 3:7 [w/w]\\\\nmixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate) as\\\\nelectrolytes (BASF SE). The areal loadings were 2.0 mAh/\\\\ncm2 at C/10 and Umax = 4.3 V. The energy densities were\\\\ncalculated from the speci ﬁc capacity and average discharge\\\\nvoltage and are given as average of two cycles from two to four\\\\ncells. Powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) was performed using a\\\\nlaboratory diﬀractometer optimized for battery research.20 The\\\\ndiﬀractometer is equipped with a molybdenum microfocus\\\\nrotating anode (Mo −Kα1,2) and a Pilatus 300 K −W area\\\\ndetector. The high brilliance of the primary beam allows\\\\npenetration of pouch cells, so that measurements can be\\\\nperformed under realistic conditions (without using custom\\\\ncells or X-ray windows). Foroperando XRD, pouch cells were\\\\nassembled inside a dry room with dew point below−50 °Cb y\\\\nstacking cathode (20 mm × 40 mm), Celgard 2500\\\\npolypropylene separator (30 mm× 50 mm) and lithium foil\\\\nanode (24 mm× 44 mm) using 250μL of LP47 (seeFigure S1\\\\nfor comparison of the cyclability of pouch cells and standard\\\\ncoin cells). Prior to XRD, the electrodes were galvanostatically\\\\ncycled in the voltage range between 3.0 and 4.3 V for three\\\\ncycles. Then, the cells were inserted into the diﬀractometer and\\\\ncharged/discharged at C/10 during the measurement. A\\\\nconstant voltage step at the cutoﬀ voltages was applied for 1\\\\nh to allow for thermodynamic equilibration of the electrode\\\\nmaterials. 2D diﬀraction images were collected in transmission\\\\ngeometry with an exposure time of 75 s. The intensity of two\\\\nconsecutive images was added up and then integrated to obtain\\\\n1D patterns for further evaluation, resulting in a total time\\\\nresolution of 150 s. Data analysis was performed by Rietveld\\\\nreﬁnement using TOPAS-Academic version 5. The instrumen-\\\\ntal resolution function was determined from an annealed CeO2\\\\nsample and described by means of a (Thompson-Cox-\\\\nHastings) pseudo-Voigt proﬁle function. 21 The analysis\\\\ncomprised reﬁnement of lattice parametersa and c and atomic\\\\ncoordinate z of the oxygen position. Both lithium (occ3a = 1.00,\\\\nocc3b = 0.02) and oxygen occupancy parameters (occ6c = 1.00)\\\\nwere ﬁxed during reﬁnement. Broadening eﬀects (apparent\\\\ncrystallite size, microstrai n etc.) were accounted for by\\\\nconvolution-based proﬁle ﬁtting as implemented in TOPAS.\\\\nThis approach is equivalent to the double-Voigt method\\\\ndescribed by Balzar et al. and is based on the integral breadth of\\\\nthe diﬀraction lines.22,23 Background reﬁnement was made\\\\nusing a 10-term Chebyshev polynomial function. Zero-point\\\\ncorrection was used to correct for sample displacement errors\\\\nof both the cathode material and Al current collector.24 The\\\\nVESTA software package was used to generate crystal structure\\\\nimages.25\\\\n■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\\\nElectrochemical Characteristics.

As is seen, the higher\\\\nthe Ni content the more Li can be extracted, and therefore the\\\\nhigher the speciﬁc capacity (see alsoFigure 2a). Besides, the\\\\nvoltage proﬁles show diﬀerent features depending on the Ni\\\\ncontent due to diﬀerent redox behavior, as indicated by the\\\\ndiﬀerential capacity curves inFigure 1b. While in the ternary\\\\nsystem of LiNiO2, LiCoO2 and LiMnO2 the TMs are formally\\\\nin the trivalent state (i.e., Ni3+,C o3+ and Mn3+), charge transfer\\\\nis assumed to occur between Ni and Mn in the LiNixCoyMnzO2\\\\nphase. The reason is the diﬀerence in electronegativity.26,27\\\\nTheoretical calculations suggest formal oxidation states of\\\\nmixed divalent and trivalent Ni, trivalent Co, and tetravalent\\\\nMn.26−28 However, the main redox active species are believed\\\\nto be Ni2+ and Ni3+, and their concentration depends on the\\\\noverall TM ratio.\\\\nAll samples show characteristic redox peaks in the voltage\\\\nrange of 3.6−3.8 V (Figure 1b). The peak splitting indicates the\\\\npresence of two Ni redox pairs (namely, Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/\\\\nNi4+) with cycling, and their shape and area ratio point to\\\\ndiﬀerent contributions depending on the Ni content.26,27 The\\\\npeaks shift toward lower voltage with increasing Ni content,\\\\nleading to a decrease in the average charge/discharge voltages.\\\\nThis phenomenon has been observed before and attributed to\\\\nthe lower redox potential of Ni than Co.13,29 Kim et al. showed\\\\nthat the electrochemical equilibrium potentials of these redox\\\\nreactions also vary with Mn content in the structure.26 Using\\\\nexperimental GITT and computational calculations they found\\\\nthat high-Ni NCMs exhibit redox activity at lower relative\\\\nvoltages. However, less Mn also leads to lower voltages for the\\\\nsame Ni content. The Ni-rich samples, in particular NCM811\\\\nand NCM851005, further show features in the high-voltage\\\\nregion above 3.9 V, which we believe are due to multiphase\\\\ntransitions caused by slight distortions in the crystal structure.\\\\nSuch transformations have been observed for LiNiO2 during\\\\ndelithiation and are likely to occur in high-Ni NCMs as well.30\\\\nBoth NCM811 and NCM851005 show an additional voltage\\\\nplateau around 4.2 V, appearing as a distinct peak in the\\\\ndiﬀerential capacity curves. This peak is not seen for the other\\\\nNCM materials, and its origin has not yet been clearly resolved.\\\\nFigure 2a depicts the speciﬁc capacity of the NCM cathodes\\\\nafter charging to 4.3 V ≤ Umax ≤ 4.6 V. As expected, both\\\\nNCM811 and NCM851005 provide the highest values,\\\\nirrespective of theUmax. At 4.3 V these cathode materials\\\\ndeliver capacities similar to that of the widely used\\\\nLiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA).31,32 The gravimetric energy\\\\ndensity (GED) calculated as the product of speciﬁc charge\\\\nand average discharge voltage is shown inFigure 2b. The GED\\\\nincreases with both increasing Ni content andUmax.\\\\nTo make a fair comparison among the di ﬀerent NCM\\\\nmaterials\\\\ue0d5also with respect to their structural stability (see\\\\nbelow)\\\\ue0d5Umax required to achieve the speci ﬁc energy of\\\\nNCM811 operated at 4.3 V (≈750 Wh/kg) was calculated\\\\nfor each composition. According to our estimates, NCM111,\\\\nNCM523, NCM622, NCM721, and NCM851005 need to be\\\\noperated at around 4.6, 4.55, 4.45, 4.4, and 4.25 V, respectively\\\\n(Figure 3). The obtained Umax values agree well with the\\\\ntechnological roadmaps of some cell manufacturers (e.g.,\\\\nNCM622 at 4.35 V in full-cells).

However, similar GEDs can be achieved\\\\nwith the low- and medium-Ni NCM materials when increasing\\\\nthe maximum operation voltage.

One is to increase\\\\nthe fraction of redox active Ni (≥80%), which allows larger\\\\namounts of Li to be extracted at a given cutoﬀ voltage (Umax).\\\\nThe other is to increase Umax, in particular for medium-Ni\\\\ncontent NCM materials. However, the accompanying lattice\\\\nchanges ultimately lead to capacity fading in both cases. Here\\\\nthe structural changes occurring in Li1.02NixCoyMnzO2 (with x\\\\n= 1/3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.85) during cycling operation in\\\\nthe voltage range between 3.0 and 4.6 V vs Li are quantiﬁed by\\\\nmeans of operando X-ray diﬀraction combined with detailed Rietveld analysis. All samples show a large decrease in unit cell\\\\nvolume upon charging, ranging from 2.4% for NCM111 (33% Ni) to 8.0% for NCM851005 (85% Ni). To make a fair\\\\ncomparison of the structural stability of the diﬀerent NCM materials, energy densities as a function ofUmax are estimated and\\\\ncorrelated with X-ray diﬀraction results. It is shown that NCMs with a lower Ni content allow for speciﬁc energies similar to that\\\\nof, e.g., Ni-rich NCM811 (80% Ni) when operated at suﬃciently high Umax, but still undergo less pronounced changes in\\\\nstructure. Nevertheless, as indicated by charge/discharge tests, the capacity retention of low- and medium-Ni content NCMs\\\\ncycled to highUmax is also strongly aﬀected by factors other than stability of the layered crystal lattice (electrolyte decomposition\\\\netc.). Overall, it is demonstrated that the complexity of the degradation processes needs to be better understood to identify\\\\noptimal cycling conditions for speciﬁc cathode compositions.\\\\n■ INTRODUCTION\\\\nThe continuous development of optimized lithium-ion batteries\\\\n(LIBs) is indispensable on the way to sustainable, cost-eﬃcient\\\\nand long-range electric vehicles (EVs). Besides the quest for\\\\nhigh power performance and good safety characteristics,\\\\nincreasing the energy density appears to be a prime goal in\\\\nthe development of next-generation LIBs.1 Layered LiCoO2\\\\n(LCO) is the state-of-the-art cathode material for commercial\\\\napplication in consumer electronics for more than 25 years.\\\\nHowever, because of the high price of cobalt metal, the speciﬁc\\\\ncosts ($/kWh) of LCO-based LIBs do not allow for the\\\\nintroduction of EVs into the mass market. Layered lithium\\\\ntransition metal (TM) oxides of the general formula LiTMO2\\\\n(with TM = 3d transition metals such as Ni, Co and Mn),2−4\\\\nso-called NCMs, allow to cut the costs and surpass the energy\\\\ndensity limit of LCO cells due to the synergetic eﬀect of the\\\\ndiﬀerent TMs.5 Current 18650 cells comprising LCO and\\\\nNCM cathode materials reach practical values of 740 Wh/L\\\\n(250 Wh/kg) and 770 Wh/L (270 Wh/kg), respectively. While\\\\nNi increases the speciﬁc capacity, Mn has a stabilizing eﬀect on\\\\nthe layered α-NaFeO2-type crystal structure and Co tends to\\\\nmix less with Li and further reduces the amount of Ni in the Li\\\\nlayers.2,6 Extraction of Li proceeds mainly through oxidation of\\\\nNi and Co,7 yet the Ni ions are believed to be the main redox\\\\nactive species in the voltage range between 3.0 and 4.2 V (vs\\\\ngraphite).8 Thus, increasing substitution of Ni by both Mn and\\\\nCo leads to a decrease in speci ﬁc capacity.9 For example,\\\\nLiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) delivers a speciﬁc capacity of\\\\nabout 150 mAh/g for Umax = 4.2 V (when cycled against\\\\ngraphite, orUmax = 4.3 V when cycled against lithium), which is\\\\nReceived: June 28, 2017\\\\nRevised: October 26, 2017\\\\nPublished: October 31, 2017\\\\nArticle\\\\npubs.acs.org/JPCC\\\\n© 2017 American Chemical Society 26163 DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06363\\\\nJ.

It is shown that\\\\nhigh-Ni NCMs (NCM811 and NCM851005) oﬀer the highest\\\\nenergy densities in the state-of-the-art voltage range of 3.0−4.3\\\\nV. However, it is important to note that low- and medium-Ni\\\\nNCMs, in principle, would be capable of delivering competitive\\\\nenergy densities if the maximum cell voltage could be increased\\\\nwithout inducing deleterious side reactions (e.g., NCM111 and\\\\nNCM622 at 4.6 and 4.45 V, respectively).\\\\nOperando X-ray diﬀraction revealed that, irrespective of the\\\\nNi content, all NCM materials are subjected to structural\\\\nchanges during operation. Yet, most importantly, it was found\\\\nthat the total change in unit cell volume increases virtually\\\\nlinearly with increasing Ni content for similar energy densities\\\\n(here based on that of NCM811 at 4.3 V). This leads us to the\\\\nassumption that increasing the Ni content results in major\\\\nchallenges in terms of mechanical strain and structural\\\\ndegradation. However, galvanostatic charge/discharge tests\\\\nindicated that Ni-rich NCMs still show better capacity\\\\nretention than low- and medium-Ni NCMs charged to higher\\\\ncutoﬀ voltages. This result emphasizes that each and every\\\\nNCM cathode material has its own issues, especially when\\\\napproaching the desired speciﬁc energy range required for\\\\napplication in electric vehicles. Thus, from a scientiﬁc point of\\\\nview, it is a must to recognize and understand the (cell-voltage-\\\\ndependent) limiting factors of the diﬀerent Ni content NCMs\\\\nand to ﬁnd solutions to optimize their performance. Besides,\\\\nthe presence and interplay of degradation processes such as\\\\nelectrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, to\\\\nname a few, need to be thoroughly investigated when dealing\\\\nwith full-cells.\\\\n■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT\\\\n*S Supporting Information\\\\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the\\\\nACS Publications websiteat DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06363.\\\\nComparison of NCM622-based pouch and coin cell\\\\nvoltage proﬁles, simulated diﬀraction patterns, contour\\\\nplots of operando XRD patterns for selected 2θ ranges,\\\\nrelative changes in lattice parameters and unit cell\\\\nvolume versus the Li content, changes inc/a ratio as a\\\\nfunction of cell voltage, Rietveld plots for NCM622, and\\\\nsummary of Rietveld reﬁnement results for eachoperando\\\\nXRD measurement (PDF)\\\\n■ AUTHOR INFORMATION\\\\nCorresponding Authors\\\\n*(L.d.B.)

Consequently, it is a\\\\nreasonable concern whether high-Ni NCMs have an intrinsic\\\\ndisadvantage over medium-Ni NCMs when it comes to cycling\\\\nstability and longevity.\\\\nTo better compare the microstructural stability among the\\\\ndiﬀerent NCM samples, the relative unit cell volume changes\\\\nwith delithiation were evaluated in more detail.Figure 9b shows\\\\nthe corresponding data forUmax = 4.3 V and when operating\\\\nthe cathode materials at a similar speci ﬁc energy or, more\\\\nspeciﬁcally, when charging to Umax required to achieve the\\\\ngravimetric energy density of NCM811 at 4.3 V (Figure 3).\\\\nInterestingly, the relative change in unit cell volume increases in\\\\na linear fashion with increasing Ni content whenUmax is\\\\nadjusted for each composition−as opposed to when the cutoﬀ\\\\nvoltage is set at 4.3 V. From these data, it is evident that Ni-rich\\\\nNCM materials are more prone to structural changes/\\\\nmechanical deformation and therefore likely to fracture during\\\\noperation (due to structural stress associated with the\\\\ncontinuous shrinking and swelling of the primary crystallites\\\\nin the secondary cathode particles).\\\\nFinally, the cycling performance of the diﬀerent Ni content\\\\nNCMs was evaluated based on our speciﬁc energy concept\\\\n(Figure 10, parts a and b). Noh et al. performed similar\\\\nexperiments using half-cells, but focused on the stability in the\\\\n3.0−4.3 V range.10 They found that the capacity retention\\\\nsigniﬁcantly decreases with increasing Ni content (Figure 10b),\\\\nwhich was explained by lower structural stability of high-Ni\\\\nNCMs. Atﬁrst glance, this result is not surprising and is also in\\\\nagreement with our data, showing a nonlinear increase in\\\\nrelative volume change with increasing Ni content (Figure 9b)\\\\nwhen the voltage on charge is limited toUmax = 4.3 V; so more\\\\nstructural degradation is expected whenUmax is not tailored to\\\\nthe speciﬁc energy. However, when doing so, weﬁnd that Ni-\\\\nrich NCMs show better capacity retention than samples with a\\\\nlow Ni content, although they have a clear disadvantage in\\\\nterms of structural stability. This result provides evidence that\\\\nthe cycle life is also strongly aﬀected by factors other than\\\\nstability of the lattice structure. Particularly when the charge\\\\ncutoﬀ voltage is increased beyond the stability limit of organic\\\\nelectrolytes, electrolyte oxidation occurs (and with that gas\\\\nevolution).41,42 For example, Dahn and co-workers showed\\\\nrecently that ethylene carbonate-containing electrolytes sig-\\\\nniﬁcantly reduce the cell performance and life at high\\\\nvoltages.43,44 Ultimately, this means that new electrolytes and\\\\nadditives are needed for high-voltage battery applications.\\\\nOverall, it is not entirely clear which NCM cell chemistry\\\\nprovides the optimum in terms of energy density and cycling\\\\nstability. To answer this question it is important to better\\\\nunderstand the diﬀerent LIB degradation processes and how\\\\nthey aﬀect each other. Clearly, for high-Ni NCMs, improving\\\\nthe structural stability is one of the major challenges toward\\\\ncommercialization, while for medium-Ni NCMs, the high\\\\n(surface) reactivity toward oxidative electrolyte decomposition\\\\nat high operating voltage must be addressed.\\\\nFigure 9.(a) Relative changes in unit cell volume as a function of cell\\\\nvoltage for the diﬀerent Ni content NCM materials.

From a scientiﬁc point of view, this means that the\\\\nmajor degradation processes need to be better understood. In\\\\nthe following we focus on the (crystallographic) volume\\\\nchanges of NCMs occurring in the voltage range between 3.0\\\\nand 4.6 V since these are known to cause mechanical stress,\\\\nwhich in turn leads to material fracture and fatigue.\\\\nStructural Characteristics. An overview of the NCM\\\\nmaterials employed in this work and their composition are\\\\ngiven inTable 1. The samples exhibit a well-developed layered\\\\ncrystalline structure ofα-NaFeO2-type (space groupR3m̅, Z =\\\\n3). It can be viewed as a stacking of alternating layers, in which\\\\nTM and Li ions occupy octahedral sites in a cubic close-packed\\\\noxygen lattice (Figure 4). The Ni, Co and Mn ions are\\\\nstatistically distributed over the 3b site inﬁrst approximation. Li\\\\nions (Wyckoﬀ site 3a) are located in the interslabs between the\\\\nTM layers. We assume that 2% of the 3b site in the TM layer\\\\nare occupied by Li ions because of the small Li excess.\\\\nThe lattice parameters of the pristine materials are given in\\\\nTable 2. An increase in a with increasing Ni content is\\\\nobserved, which is due to the larger ionic radii of Ni2+ (0.69 Å)\\\\nand Ni3+ (0.56 Å) compared to Co3+ (0.545 Å) and Mn4+\\\\n(0.530 Å).33 In contrast, c decreases, which is somewhat\\\\nsurprising and seems to be related to the content of all three\\\\nTMs (rather than Ni only). For example, substitution of Mn by\\\\nCo is known to cause a decrease in both lattice parameters.34\\\\nTo gain insight into the evolution of the host structure with\\\\ncycling, a series of operando XRD measurements were\\\\nperformed on the diﬀerent NCM materials. Prior to XRD,\\\\nthe cells were cycled between 3.0 and 4.3 Vﬁrst at C/10 for\\\\ntwo cycles and then at C/5 for another cycle. The Li contentδ\\\\nper formula unit was around 1.02 for the pristine samples. To\\\\nestimateδ at the beginning and end of the fourth charge cycle,\\\\nwe assumed that Coulombic eﬃciencies of less than 100% are a\\\\nresult of Li loss from the cathode material only. This loss of\\\\nactive Li during precycling was taken into account when\\\\ncalculating the amount of transferred Li+ ions. The NCM cells\\\\nexhibited open-circuit voltages ranging from 3.57 to 3.65 V\\\\nprior to the fourth cycle. As can be seen fromTable 1, δ was\\\\n≤0.21 after charging (note that a constant voltage step atUmax\\\\n= 4.6 V was applied for 1 h).\\\\nFigure 5depicts contour plots ofoperando XRD patterns for\\\\nNCM622. The evolution of the re ﬂection positions and\\\\nintensities is shown together with the voltage pro ﬁle. We\\\\nnote that Bragg reﬂections other than those originating from\\\\nthe cathode material can be assigned to aluminum (from the\\\\ncurrent collector and pouch cell foil). A distincthkl-dependent\\\\nshift is observed during cycling. The reﬂections withh=k =0\\\\nand l ≠ 0 (e.g., 003)ﬁrst shift to lower 2θ values in the charge\\\\ncycle. However, when the cell reaches a voltage of about 4.0 V,\\\\nthey shift back to the initial positions or to even larger 2θ\\\\nvalues. In contrast, the reﬂections with h ≠ 0, k ≠ 0 and l =0\\\\n(e.g., 110) show the opposite trend in that they shift almost\\\\nexclusively toward larger 2θ values. Reverse shifts are observed\\\\nupon discharge, and all reﬂections virtually reach their initial\\\\npositions at the end of the cycle. This leads us to conclude that\\\\nthe layered structure is well preserved. However, a slight\\\\nFigure 3.Charge cutoﬀ voltage as a function of Ni content required to\\\\nachieve the gravimetric energy density of NCM811 atUmax = 4.3 V.\\\\nTable 1.
