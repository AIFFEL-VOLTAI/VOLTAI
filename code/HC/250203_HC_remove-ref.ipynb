      "performed in an attempt to identify the composition providing\n",
      "the optimum in energy density and stability. It is shown that\n",
      "high-Ni NCMs (NCM811 and NCM851005) oﬀer the highest\n",
      "energy densities in the state-of-the-art voltage range of 3.0−4.3\n",
      "V. However, it is important to note that low- and medium-Ni\n",
      "NCMs, in principle, would be capable of delivering competitive\n",
      "energy densities if the maximum cell voltage could be increased\n",
      "without inducing deleterious side reactions (e.g., NCM111 and\n",
      "NCM622 at 4.6 and 4.45 V, respectively).\n",

      "in terms of mechanical\n",
      "\n",
      "Operando X-ray diﬀraction revealed that, irrespective of the\n",
      "Ni content, all NCM materials are subjected to structural\n",
      "changes during operation. Yet, most importantly, it was found\n",
      "that the total change in unit cell volume increases virtually\n",
      "linearly with increasing Ni content for similar energy densities\n",
      "(here based on that of NCM811 at 4.3 V). This leads us to the\n",
      "assumption that increasing the Ni content results in major\n",
      "challenges\n",

       " '■ INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe continuous development of optimized lithium-ion batteries\\n(LIBs) is indispensable on the way to sustainable, cost-efficient\\nand long-range electric vehicles (EVs). Besides the quest for\\nhigh power performance and good safety characteristics,\\nincreasing the energy density appears to be a prime goal in\\nthe development of next-generation LIBs.1 Layered LiCoO2\\n(LCO) is the state-of-the-art cathode material for commercial\\napplication in consumer electronics for more than 25 years.\\nHowever, because of the high price of cobalt metal, the specific\\ncosts ($/kWh) of LCO-based LIBs do not allow for the\\nintroduction of EVs into the mass market. Layered lithium\\ntransition metal (TM) oxides of the general formula LiTMO2\\n(with TM = 3d transition metals such as Ni, Co and Mn),2−4\\nso-called NCMs, allow to cut the costs and surpass the energy\\ndensity limit of LCO cells due to the synergetic effect of the\\ndifferent TMs.5 Current 18650 cells comprising LCO and\\n\\nNCM cathode materials reach practical values of 740 Wh/L\\n(250 Wh/kg) and 770 Wh/L (270 Wh/kg), respectively. While\\nNi increases the specific capacity, Mn has a stabilizing effect on\\nthe layered α-NaFeO2-type crystal structure and Co tends to\\nmix less with Li and further reduces the amount of Ni in the Li\\nlayers.2,6 Extraction of Li proceeds mainly through oxidation of\\nNi and Co,7 yet the Ni ions are believed to be the main redox\\nactive species in the voltage range between 3.0 and 4.2 V (vs\\ngraphite).8 Thus, increasing substitution of Ni by both Mn and\\nCo leads to a decrease in specific capacity.9 For example,\\nLiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) delivers a specific capacity of\\nabout 150 mAh/g for Umax = 4.2 V (when cycled against\\ngraphite, or Umax = 4.3 V when cycled against lithium), which is\\n\\nJune 28, 2017',\n",

One is to increase\\nthe fraction of redox active Ni (≥80%), which allows larger\\namounts of Li to be extracted at a given cutoﬀ voltage (Umax).\\nThe other is to increase Umax,\\nin particular for medium-Ni\\ncontent NCM materials. However, the accompanying lattice\\nchanges ultimately lead to capacity fading in both cases. Here\\nthe structural changes occurring in Li1.02NixCoyMnzO2 (with x\\n= 1/3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.85) during cycling operation in\\nthe voltage range between 3.0 and 4.6 V vs Li are quantiﬁed by\\nmeans of operando X-ray diﬀraction combined with detailed Rietveld analysis. All samples show a large decrease in unit cell\\nvolume upon charging, ranging from 2.4% for NCM111 (33% Ni) to 8.0% for NCM851005 (85% Ni). To make a fair\\ncomparison of the structural stability of the diﬀerent NCM materials, energy densities as a function of Umax are estimated and\\ncorrelated with X-ray diﬀraction results. It is shown that NCMs with a lower Ni content allow for speciﬁc energies similar to that\\nof, e.g., Ni-rich NCM811 (80% Ni) when operated at suﬃciently high Umax, but still undergo less pronounced changes in\\nstructure. Nevertheless, as indicated by charge/discharge tests, the capacity retention of low- and medium-Ni content NCMs\\ncycled to high Umax is also strongly aﬀected by factors other than stability of the layered crystal lattice (electrolyte decomposition\\netc.). Overall, it is demonstrated that the complexity of the degradation processes needs to be better understood to identify\\noptimal cycling conditions for speciﬁc cathode compositions.',\n",

One is to increase\\nthe fraction of redox active Ni (≥80%), which allows larger\\namounts of Li to be extracted at a given cutoﬀ voltage (Umax). The other is to increase Umax,\\nin particular for medium-Ni\\ncontent NCM materials. However, the accompanying lattice\\nchanges ultimately lead to capacity fading in both cases. Here\\nthe structural changes occurring in Li1.02NixCoyMnzO2 (with x\\n= 1/3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.85) during cycling operation in\\nthe voltage range between 3.0 and 4.6 V vs Li are quantiﬁed by\\nmeans of operando X-ray diﬀraction combined with detailed Rietveld analysis. All samples show a large decrease in unit cell\\nvolume upon charging, ranging from 2.4% for NCM111 (33% Ni) to 8.0% for NCM851005 (85% Ni). To make a fair\\ncomparison of the structural stability of the diﬀerent NCM materials, energy densities as a function of Umax are estimated and\\ncorrelated with X-ray diﬀraction results. It is shown that NCMs with a lower Ni content allow for speciﬁc energies similar to that\\nof, e.g., Ni-rich NCM811 (80% Ni) when operated at suﬃciently high Umax, but still undergo less pronounced changes in\\nstructure. Nevertheless, as indicated by charge/discharge tests, the capacity retention of low- and medium-Ni content NCMs\\ncycled to high Umax is also strongly aﬀected by factors other than stability of the layered crystal lattice (electrolyte decomposition\\netc.). Overall, it is demonstrated that the complexity of the degradation processes needs to be better understood to identify\\noptimal cycling conditions for speciﬁc cathode compositions. ■ INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe continuous development of optimized lithium-ion batteries\\n(LIBs) is indispensable on the way to sustainable, cost-eﬃcient\\nand long-range electric vehicles (EVs). Besides the quest for\\nhigh power performance and good safety characteristics,\\nincreasing the energy density appears to be a prime goal in\\nthe development of next-generation LIBs.1 Layered LiCoO2\\n(LCO) is the state-of-the-art cathode material for commercial\\napplication in consumer electronics for more than 25 years. However, because of the high price of cobalt metal, the speciﬁc\\ncosts ($/kWh) of LCO-based LIBs do not allow for the\\nintroduction of EVs into the mass market. Layered lithium\\ntransition metal (TM) oxides of the general formula LiTMO2\\n(with TM = 3d transition metals such as Ni, Co and Mn),2−4\\nso-called NCMs, allow to cut the costs and surpass the energy\\ndensity limit of LCO cells due to the synergetic eﬀect of the\\ndiﬀerent TMs.5 Current 18650 cells comprising LCO and\\n\\nNCM cathode materials reach practical values of 740 Wh/L\\n(250 Wh/kg) and 770 Wh/L (270 Wh/kg), respectively. While\\nNi increases the speciﬁc capacity, Mn has a stabilizing eﬀect on\\nthe layered α-NaFeO2-type crystal structure and Co tends to\\nmix less with Li and further reduces the amount of Ni in the Li\\nlayers.2,6 Extraction of Li proceeds mainly through oxidation of\\nNi and Co,7 yet the Ni ions are believed to be the main redox\\nactive species in the voltage range between 3.0 and 4.2 V (vs\\ngraphite).8 Thus, increasing substitution of Ni by both Mn and\\nCo leads to a decrease in speciﬁc capacity.9 For example,\\nLiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) delivers a speciﬁc capacity of\\nabout 150 mAh/g for Umax = 4.2 V (when cycled against\\ngraphite, or Umax = 4.3 V when cycled against lithium), which is\\n\\nJune 28, 2017\\n\\nReceived:\\nRevised: October 26, 2017\\nPublished: October 31, 2017\\n\\n© 2017 American Chemical Society\\n\\n26163\\n\\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06363\\nJ.

In recent years, it has\\nbeen demonstrated that high-Ni LiNixCoyMnzO2 (x ≫ 1/3)\\nallow for much higher degrees of delithiation, and therefore\\nspeciﬁc capacities in excess of 150 mAh/g.10 Nevertheless,\\nincreasing the Ni content is associated with a decrease in\\ncapacity retention, which is a major drawback so far.11 Part of\\nthe reason for this is the fact that Ni-rich materials suﬀer from\\nlarger volumetric changes with delithiation,\\nleading to more\\nfailure.10,12−15 Besides,\\nsevere degradation and mechanical\\nincreasing the Ni content results in increased surface reactivity\\n(electrolyte decomposition).16−18\\n\\nAnother strategy to improve the energy density is to increase\\nthe charge cutoﬀ voltage to over 4.3 V vs Li. For the sake of\\nclarity, all voltages are given with respect to Li/Li+ in the\\nfollowing (note that the voltage diﬀerence among cells using\\ngraphite [full-cell geometry] and lithium metal anodes [half-cell\\ngeometry] is around −100 mV). As an example, NCM111 has\\nbeen reported to deliver a speciﬁc capacity of about 200 mAh/g\\nin the voltage range from 2.5 to 4.6 V.2 However, charging\\nNCM cathode materials to higher states of charge (SOC) is\\naccompanied by more pronounced changes\\nin lattice\\nstructure.10,13,19\\n\\nFrom both industrial and scientiﬁc points of view,\\nthe\\nquestion what cathode composition and voltage range provides\\nthe optimum in terms of energy density, costs, stability and\\nsafety is yet to be answered. For automotive applications, in\\nimportant\\nparticular, energy density is one of\\nparameters. In literature, electrode materials for LIBs are\\noften benchmarked for a given voltage range or degree of\\n(de)lithiation. For example, Ishidzu et al. studied and compared\\nthe volume changes of NCMs of diﬀerent composition in the\\nvoltage range of 2.5−4.5 V.13 Nevertheless, from a techno-\\nlogical point of view, the mere evaluation of, e.g., cycling\\nstability for a given maximum cell voltage may not be suﬃcient. Cells using low-Ni NCMs typically last signiﬁcantly longer than\\nhigh-Ni NCM-based cells when operated in the same voltage\\nrange. However, for the latter, a signiﬁcantly lower maximum\\ncell voltage would be required for achieving similar energy\\ndensities. the most\\n\\nIn this work, we show that NCM111 and NCM811 cells\\nprovide virtually the same energy density at 4.6 and 4.3 V,\\nrespectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\\nis very\\nimportant to analyze both the performance and structural\\ndegradation of diﬀerent Ni content NCM cathodes for a given\\nenergy level rather than voltage range in a reference-type LIB. To allow for a reasonable performance assessment, we estimate\\nthe energy densities as a function of Umax for a variety of NCMs\\nand correlate the results with structural properties of\\nthe\\nmaterials from operando X-ray diﬀraction. it\\n\\n■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\\n\\nLi1.02NixMnyCozO2 (x + y + z = 1) cathode materials with x:y:z\\n= 1:1:1 (NCM111), 5:2:3 (NCM523), 6:2:2 (NCM622), 7:2:1\\n(NCM721), 8:1:1 (NCM811) and 85:10:5 (NCM851005)\\nwere obtained from BASF SE (Ludwigshafen, Germany). All\\nelectrodes were prepared by slurry casting onto Al foil using a\\nKTF-S roll-to-roll coater (Mathis AG). For NCM622,\\nNCM721, NCM811 and NCM851005, slurries were obtained\\nby dispersing cathode material (94 wt %), Super C65 (1 wt %,\\nTimcal) and SFG6L (2 wt %, Timcal) conductive carbon\\nadditives as well as Solef 5130 PVDF binder (3 wt %, Solvay) in\\n1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NEP). For NCM111 and NCM523,\\nslurries were obtained by dispersing cathode material (93 wt\\n\\nArticle\\n\\n%), Super C65 (1.5 wt %) and SFG6L (2.5 wt %) conductive\\ncarbon additives as well as Solef 5130 PVDF binder (3 wt %) in\\nNEP. Electrochemical characterization was conducted at 25 °C on\\ncoin-type cells. The cells were assembled inside an Ar-ﬁlled\\nglovebox (MBraun) by stacking cathode, glass microﬁber\\nseparator (GF/D, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Whatman) and\\nlithium foil anode (Albemarle Germany GmbH) of diameters\\n13, 17, and 13 mm, respectively, using 250 μL of either LP30 (1\\nM LiPF6 in a 1:1 [wt/wt] mixture of ethylene carbonate and\\ndimethyl carbonate) or LP47 (1 M LiPF6 in a 3:7 [w/w]\\nmixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate) as\\nloadings were 2.0 mAh/\\nelectrolytes (BASF SE). The areal\\ncm2 at C/10 and Umax = 4.3 V. The energy densities were\\ncalculated from the speciﬁc capacity and average discharge\\nvoltage and are given as average of two cycles from two to four\\ncells. Powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) was performed using a\\nlaboratory diﬀractometer optimized for battery research.20 The\\ndiﬀractometer is equipped with a molybdenum microfocus\\nrotating anode (Mo−Kα\\n1,2) and a Pilatus 300 K−W area\\ndetector. The high brilliance of\\nthe primary beam allows\\npenetration of pouch cells, so that measurements can be\\nperformed under realistic conditions (without using custom\\ncells or X-ray windows). For operando XRD, pouch cells were\\nassembled inside a dry room with dew point below −50 °C by\\nstacking cathode (20 mm × 40 mm), Celgard 2500\\npolypropylene separator (30 mm × 50 mm) and lithium foil\\nanode (24 mm × 44 mm) using 250 μL of LP47 (see Figure S1\\nfor comparison of the cyclability of pouch cells and standard\\ncoin cells). Prior to XRD, the electrodes were galvanostatically\\ncycled in the voltage range between 3.0 and 4.3 V for three\\ncycles. Then, the cells were inserted into the diﬀractometer and\\ncharged/discharged at C/10 during the measurement. A\\nconstant voltage step at the cutoﬀ voltages was applied for 1\\nh to allow for thermodynamic equilibration of the electrode\\nmaterials. 2D diﬀraction images were collected in transmission\\ngeometry with an exposure time of 75 s. The intensity of two\\nconsecutive images was added up and then integrated to obtain\\n1D patterns for further evaluation, resulting in a total time\\nresolution of 150 s. Data analysis was performed by Rietveld\\nreﬁnement using TOPAS-Academic version 5. The instrumen-\\ntal resolution function was determined from an annealed CeO2\\nsample and described by means of a (Thompson-Cox-\\nHastings) pseudo-Voigt proﬁle function.21 The analysis\\ncomprised reﬁnement of lattice parameters a and c and atomic\\ncoordinate z of the oxygen position. Both lithium (occ3a = 1.00,\\nocc3b = 0.02) and oxygen occupancy parameters (occ6c = 1.00)\\nwere ﬁxed during reﬁnement. Broadening eﬀects (apparent\\ncrystallite size, microstrain etc.) were accounted for by\\nconvolution-based proﬁle ﬁtting as implemented in TOPAS. This approach is equivalent\\nto the double-Voigt method\\ndescribed by Balzar et al. and is based on the integral breadth of\\nthe diﬀraction lines.22,23 Background reﬁnement was made\\nusing a 10-term Chebyshev polynomial function. Zero-point\\ncorrection was used to correct for sample displacement errors\\nof both the cathode material and Al current collector.24 The\\nVESTA software package was used to generate crystal structure\\nimages.25\\n\\n■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\n\\nElectrochemical Characteristics.

As is seen, the higher\\nthe Ni content the more Li can be extracted, and therefore the\\nhigher the speciﬁc capacity (see also Figure 2a). Besides, the\\nvoltage proﬁles show diﬀerent features depending on the Ni\\ncontent due to diﬀerent redox behavior, as indicated by the\\ndiﬀerential capacity curves in Figure 1b. While in the ternary\\nsystem of LiNiO2, LiCoO2 and LiMnO2 the TMs are formally\\nin the trivalent state (i.e., Ni3+, Co3+ and Mn3+), charge transfer\\nis assumed to occur between Ni and Mn in the LiNixCoyMnzO2\\nphase. The reason is the diﬀerence in electronegativity.26,27\\nTheoretical calculations suggest\\nformal oxidation states of\\nmixed divalent and trivalent Ni, trivalent Co, and tetravalent\\nMn.26−28 However, the main redox active species are believed\\nto be Ni2+ and Ni3+, and their concentration depends on the\\noverall TM ratio. All samples show characteristic redox peaks in the voltage\\nrange of 3.6−3.8 V (Figure 1b). The peak splitting indicates the\\npresence of two Ni redox pairs (namely, Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/\\nNi4+) with cycling, and their shape and area ratio point to\\ndiﬀerent contributions depending on the Ni content.26,27 The\\npeaks shift toward lower voltage with increasing Ni content,\\nleading to a decrease in the average charge/discharge voltages. This phenomenon has been observed before and attributed to\\nthe lower redox potential of Ni than Co.13,29 Kim et al. showed\\nthat the electrochemical equilibrium potentials of these redox\\nreactions also vary with Mn content in the structure.26 Using\\nexperimental GITT and computational calculations they found\\nthat high-Ni NCMs exhibit redox activity at lower relative\\nvoltages. However, less Mn also leads to lower voltages for the\\nsame Ni content. The Ni-rich samples, in particular NCM811\\nand NCM851005, further show features in the high-voltage\\n\\nsimilar\\n\\nto that of\\n\\nregion above 3.9 V, which we believe are due to multiphase\\ntransitions caused by slight distortions in the crystal structure. Such transformations have been observed for LiNiO2 during\\ndelithiation and are likely to occur in high-Ni NCMs as well.30\\nBoth NCM811 and NCM851005 show an additional voltage\\nplateau around 4.2 V, appearing as a distinct peak in the\\ndiﬀerential capacity curves. This peak is not seen for the other\\nNCM materials, and its origin has not yet been clearly resolved.

However, it is important to note that low- and medium-Ni\\nNCMs, in principle, would be capable of delivering competitive\\nenergy densities if the maximum cell voltage could be increased\\nwithout inducing deleterious side reactions (e.g., NCM111 and\\nNCM622 at 4.6 and 4.45 V, respectively). in terms of mechanical\\n\\nOperando X-ray diﬀraction revealed that, irrespective of the\\nNi content, all NCM materials are subjected to structural\\nchanges during operation. Yet, most importantly, it was found\\nthat the total change in unit cell volume increases virtually\\nlinearly with increasing Ni content for similar energy densities\\n(here based on that of NCM811 at 4.3 V). This leads us to the\\nassumption that increasing the Ni content results in major\\nchallenges\\nstrain and structural\\ndegradation.
