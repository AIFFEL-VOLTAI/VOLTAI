One of the most important of these technologies is\\nhigh-performance rechargeable batteries. Lithium-ion batteries\\n(LIBs) with high speciﬁc capacity and long cyclic life have been\\ndeveloped for use in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), full electric\\nvehicles (EVs) and electronic devices such as smart cell phones and\\nlaptop computers [1e3].\\nCathode materials with layered structures have received a\\nconsiderable attention in recent years. One of the early instances is\\nLiCoO2 that was widely used as theﬁrst generation of commercial\\nLIBs due to its easy preparation and outstanding cycling stability\\n[4,5]. Various substitutes for cobalt component have been studied\\ndue to the limitations that originate from its safety issues, toxicity,\\nand performance degradation when the battery overcharges [6,7].\\nLithium nickel oxide (LiNiO2) with ana-NaFeO2 structure is another\\ncandidate for use in LIBs [8]. This cathode is cheaper and possesses\\na higher energy density, but lower stability and structural ordering\\nthan LiCoO2 [9]. Moreover, weak capacity reversibility and low\\ncyclic stability are the other disadvantages of LiNiO2. Adding cobalt\\nto LiNiO2 makes it more stable and increases the degree of ordering\\nby decreasing cation mixing [10,11]. Another cathode used in Li-ion\\nbatteries is LiMnO2, which has a layered crystal structure as well\\n[12]. However, the layered LiMnO2 suffers from the structural\\ninstability during electrochemical cycling, and thus, exhibits a\\nsigniﬁcant capacity fading [13,14]. To take advantages of all these\\nmaterials in a combinational design, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM\\nlayered oxide) wasﬁrst prepared in 2001 [15] as a battery material\\nwith a high speciﬁc capacity, low cost, and high safety. NCM ma-\\nterials have been synthesized by various methods including co-\\nprecipitation, sol-gel, solid-state reactions, hydrothermal, micro-\\nemulsion, and solution combustion [16,17]. However, the electro-\\nchemical performance of NCM is limited due to its poor electronic\\nconductivity [17,18].\\nGraphene as a two-dimensional material discovered in 2004 has\\nmany applications in nanotechnology and nanoscience. As an\\nexample, graphene materials have been added to AgInZnS for in-\\nvivo bio-imaging applications [19], CsPbBr3 to enhance the X-ray\\nphoton response [20], and Cu2O nanoparticles to improve the\\nperformance of light-controlled conductive switching [ 21]. To\\nenhance the conductivity of the battery materials including NCM,\\nresearchers have been attempted to reduce their particle size and/* Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: maisam_jalaly@iust.ac.ir (M.

Graphene\\n(and its hybrids) in graphene-based Li batteries usually functions as\\nthe material support, material mediator, electrode framework, or\\nelectrode modiﬁer [23]. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) due to its\\nexcellent electrical conductivity and high surface area has the po-\\ntential for use in Li-ion batteries. In this regard, the LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/\\n3O2e10 wt% graphene composite was prepared by the ball-milling\\nprocess, and the discharge capacity for NCM and NCMeRGO com-\\nposite was obtained as 174.6 and 185.3 mAh/g, respectively [24].\\nThe improvement in the electrochemical properties of a battery\\ncontaining the NCMeRGO composite is attributed to the decrease\\nin the pathway of lithium ions, the enhancement of the electron\\ntransfer rate, and the creation of the electrochemically active sites\\nfor intercalation of lithium ions [ 24,25]. Using the graphene\\nnetwork along with NCM material as a cathode material in the LIBs\\nhas improved the capacity, rate capability, and the cyclic stability of\\nthe battery [26].\\nThe combination of the NCM nanoparticles synthesized by the\\nsolution combustion route and graphene sheets produced from the\\nmicrowave reduction of graphene oxide (GO) is the novel goal of\\nthe present study. Furthermore, the effects of microwave-prepared\\ngraphene as a conductive additive on the electrochemical perfor-\\nmance of the Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 cathode are also investigated.\\n2. Experimental\\nGraphene oxide (GO) aqueous suspension was prepared from\\ngraphite powder using the modi ﬁed Hummers’method. Flake\\ngraphite (1 g) and KMnO4 (3 g) were added to the mixture of H2SO4\\nand H3PO4 and vigorously stirred for a few days. Next, the reaction\\nmixture was poured onto the corresponding amount of H2O2 (30%)\\nand ice. The yellow product was frequently leached and washed by\\nthe hydrochloric acid and deionized water during centrifugation.\\nThe resultant brown GO dispersion was achieved, which was stable\\nfor more than 6 months. The GO suspension was centrifuged at\\n10,000 rpm for 1 h and dried at 80/C14 C for 1 h. The GO paste was then\\nexposed to the microwave irradiation for 10 s to produce reduced\\ngraphene oxide (RGO)ﬂakes.\\nThe layered LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM) was prepared based on\\nour previous report [27]. Concisely, stoichiometric amounts of\\ninitial precursors including nickel nitrate (Merck, 99%), manganese\\nnitrate (Merck, 99%), cobalt nitrate (Merck, 99%), and lithium ni-\\ntrate (Acros, 99%) were dissolved in the deionized water to form a\\nstable solution. The mixture was stirred for 2 h. To ignite the so-\\nlution, urea (Sinchem, 99%) as the fuel was added to the nitrate\\nsolution and stirred for 3 h. Then, the temperature of the solution\\nwas increased to 180 /C14 C to start the combustion process. The\\ncollected powder was calcined at 850/C14 C for 15 h. The combustion\\nreaction is given below:\\nLiNO3 þ 0.33 Ni(NO3)2.6H2O þ 0.33 Co(NO3)2.6H2O þ 0.33\\nMn(NO3)2.4H2O þ 2.33 CO(NH2)2 ¼ LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 þ 3.82\\nN2 þ 10H2O þ2.33 CO2\\nDifferent fractions of RGO (1, 3 and 5 wt %) were used to fabri-\\ncate the NCMeRGO composite. The composite was in-situ prepared\\nduring cathode preparation. To fabricate the cathode electrode,\\npolyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF, 10 wt %) was dissolved in N-Methyl-\\n2-pyrrolidone (NMP) using a magnetic stirrer. RGO was separately\\ndispersed in the NMP for 2 h to obtain a uniform distribution. The\\nsynthesized NCM powder was next added to form the NCMeRGO\\nsuspension by stirring at 1000 rpm followed by a severe sonicat-\\nion for 1 h. Subsequently, the PVDF solution was added to the\\nNCMeRGO suspension under continuous magnetic stirring for\\n30 min. Finally, 3e4 wt. % carbon black was added to the slurry, and\\nthe whole mixture was stirred for 2 h. The slurry was coated on an\\naluminum foil by a tape casting machine. The obtained coating was\\ndried in an oven at 100/C14 C for 3 h. The NCM cathode samples\\ncontaining 0, 1, 3, and 5 wt % RGO additive are called NR0, NR1, NR3,\\nand NR5, respectively.\\nThe electrochemical performances of the as-prepared cathode\\nmaterials were measured for coin-type cells (CR2032). The coin\\ncells were assembled in an argon-ﬁlled glove box with less than\\n1 ppm oxygen and water, using lithium metal as the counter/\\nreference electrode. Also, a Celgard 2400 polypropylene membrane\\nwas used as the battery separator. The electrolyte used in the coin\\ncell was a solution of 1 M LiPF6 in a 1:1 mixture of ethylene car-\\nbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The electrochemical per-\\nformance of the assembled cell was assessed using a battery tester\\nin the range of 2.5e4.3 V. Using an OFG500 OrigaFlex instrument,\\nelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ESI) was carried out in\\nthe frequency range of 100 kHze10 mHz by applying 5 mV AC\\nvoltage. The crystal structure of the samples was checked by X-ray\\npowder diffraction (XRD, Philips PW 1730) with Cu-Ka radiation\\n(l ¼ 0.15406 nm). Field emission scanning electron microscope\\n(FESEM, TESCAN MIRA3) and transmission electron microscope\\n(TEM, EM208S Philips 100 kV) were used to study the morphology\\nand microstructure of the materials. UVeVis spectroscopy mea-\\nsurements were performed on the graphene nanosheets using a\\nShimadzu UV1700 UVeVis spectrometer.\\n3. Results and discussion\\nThe cathode material with a chemical formula of LiNi1/3Co1/\\n3Mn1/3O2 was synthesized by the solution combustion followed by\\nthe calcination at 850/C14 C for 15 h, as mentioned above. The XRD\\npattern of the NCM after the calcination process is shown inFig. 1.\\nThe well-known hexagonal structure of the NCM with its principal\\ncrystallographic planes of (003) and (104) is detected. There are\\napparent splits between (006)e(102) and (108)e(110) doublets,\\nindicating the formation of an excellent layered structure [28e30].\\nFurthermore, the XRD intensity ratioI(003)/I(104) of the material,\\nwhich should be larger than 1.2 to have a small cation mixing and\\nshow an acceptable battery performance [30e32], was calculated\\nto be 1.36. Another measure for evaluating the excellence of the\\nmaterial structure is the ratio of hexagonal lattice parameters (c/a)\\nwhich should be larger than 4.899 to show a more layered crystal\\nstructure and favors the intercalation process [27]. The values ofa,\\nc, andc/a ratio for the synthesized NCM material were calculated to\\nbe 2.868 Å, 14.233 Å, and 4.963, respectively, indicating the\\nFig. 1.

A more detailed discussion\\non the structural speciﬁcations of the produced NCM has been\\nprovided in our previous paper [27]. Therefore, the NCM synthe-\\nsized is expected to have a microstructure with a higher lattice\\nordering and appropriate electrochemical behavior.\\nFig. 2displays the SEM micrographs of the NCM synthesized by\\nthe combustion route at different magniﬁcations. A uniform dis-\\ntribution of the particle size with no signiﬁcant agglomeration is\\nclearly observed inFig. 2 (a). The NCM particles were obtained with\\na narrow size range of 200e300 nm and faceted morphology, as\\nshown in Fig. 2 (b). The shapes of the particles are like regular\\npolyhedrons with smooth surfaces, implying high crystallinity of\\nthe material [33].\\nThe graphene-based materials synthesized by the chemical\\nexfoliation were evaluated. The X-ray diffraction patterns of GO and\\nRGO are shown in Fig. 3. The full conversion of GO to RGO is\\ndetected through disappearance of the characteristic XRD peak of\\nGO located at 2q z 10/C14 (Fig. 3 (a)) and appearance of the charac-\\nteristic XRD peak of RGO located at 2q z 25/C14 (Fig. 3 (b)), implying\\nthe full reduction of graphene oxide [34,35]. Fig. 3(c) and (d) show\\nthe Raman spectra of GO and RGO. Two characteristic vibration\\nbands of D and G are observed in the range of 1000e2000 cm/C0 1.\\nThe G band, which corresponds to theﬁrst-order of the E2g pho-\\nnons of the sp2 carbon atoms, locates at 1588 and 1592 cm/C0 1 for GO\\nand RGO, respectively. The D band, which is caused by breathing\\nmode ofk-point photons of A1g symmetry and corresponds to the\\nsp3-hybridized carbon atoms, defects, disordering and edges, lo-\\ncates at 1357 and 1361 cm/C0 1 for GO and RGO, respectively [36,37].\\nAfter the reduction process, the intensity ratio of D band to G band\\n(ID/IG) was considerably increased from 0.85 for GO to 1.02 for RGO.\\nSince D band results from sp2 carbon clusters, higher intensity of D\\nband can be attributed to the creation of a large number of small-\\nsized graphene domains and removal of oxygenated species\\n[36,37].\\nUV-Vis absorbance spectra of the graphene oxide (GO) nano-\\nsheets and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) are shown inFig. 04.A s\\ncan be observed, GO indicates two characteristic UV-Vis absorption\\npeaks. The main one centered at 228 nm is assigned topep*\\ntransition of the C¼C bonds and the weak shoulder located at\\n300 nm corresponds to nep* transition of the C¼O bonds [33]. The\\nreduction of GO, which has a highly defective surface with a dis-\\nrupted sp 2-network, restores the p-network, consequently\\nproviding more conductivity and absorption properties. By\\nreducing the graphene oxide using the microwave irradiation, the\\n228 nm peak red-shifted to about 260 nm due to the restoration of\\nthe p-conjugated structure of the graphene sheet [22,23,26,36,38].\\nOn the other hand, the 300 nm shoulder disappeared, conﬁrming\\nthe removal of the oxygenated functional groups and completion of\\nthe reduction process [38].\\nFig. 5 shows the micrographs of the graphene nanosheets and\\nNCMeRGO nanocomposite. SEM image from synthesized RGO in\\nFig. 5 (a) indicates thin carbon sheets, which have a relatively\\naggregated structure with wrinkled surfaces and folding. The TEM\\nimage inFig. 5 (b)shows a graphene sheet supported on the TEM\\nholder. This image was taken after the sonication and dispersion of\\nthe graphene sheets in water. The sheet with folding edges has a\\n1e2 mm lateral size.Fig. 5(c) and (d) depict the TEM micrographs of\\nthe NCMeRGO composite in which the transparent RGO sheets are\\nwrapped around either an individual NCM nanoparticle or a bunch\\nof oxide particles. Cathodes with higher surface areas take advan-\\ntage of reducing the lithium-ion diffusion pathway and improving\\nthe contact between the electrode and electrolyte [39]. Establishing\\nthe connection between NCM particles and RGO nanosheets is the\\nmain reason for obtaining high capacity, better cycling stability, and\\nrate capability. The better the connection between the NCM\\nnanoparticles and RGO is, the higher the electrical conductivity of\\nthe cathode material will be [18]. Fig. 5(c) and (d) indicate ultra-\\nsonic treatment during processing causes the NCM nanoparticles to\\nbe wrapped up by thin RGO nanosheets, forming a core-shell-like\\nstructure.\\nAs mentioned above, the RGO was added to the NCM at 0, 1, 3,\\nand 5 wt % to fabricate a composite LIB cathode.Fig. 6displays the\\ninitial charge-discharge curves for NR0, NR1, NR3, and NR5 samples\\nin the range of 2.5e4.3 V at 0.05C rate. The initial charge and\\ndischarge capacity values for all samples are tabulated inTable 1.A s\\ncan be seen, the sample NR5 with the charge and discharge ca-\\npacities of 209.2 and 186.6 mAh/g, respectively, exhibits the best\\ncapacity values so that its initial discharge capacity is about 11%\\nhigher than that of pristine NCM cathode without graphene (NR0).\\nThis result is strictly comparable with the results reported by Li\\net al. [1]. They synthesized LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 by a facile wet\\nchemical route and prepared a nanocomposite containing\\nNCMe10 wt % RGO with the discharge capacity of 196 mAh/g. A\\nmesoporous graphene (4 wt %) modiﬁed NCM cathode was also\\nrecently fabricated [ 40], and the measurement of the initial\\ndischarge capacity indicated a low value of ~130 mAh/g at a small\\ncurrent density of 50 mA/g in the voltage range of 2.5e4.1 V. The\\nmajor roles of the graphene in the enhancement of the battery\\ncapacity is as follows: (1) RGO with its good conductivity facilitates\\nthe fast electron transport to the current collector. (2) RGO sheets\\nFig. 2. (a) SEM image of the NCM after combustion synthesis and thermal calcination, (b) higher magniﬁcation.\\nA.

Besides, SEI cover acts as an obstacle to ion transport,\\nlimiting the Li-ion migration rate and intercalation/deintercalation\\nprocess [43]. The RGO coating can protect the NCM surfaces and\\ndiminish the contact between the cathode materials and electro-\\nlyte, preventing the decomposition of the electrolyte and devel-\\nopment of the SEI layer [44]. Here, the NR5 sample presents the\\nhighest capacity retention during initial charge-discharge, as\\nshown inTable 1. In fact, by increasing the percentage of graphene\\nadditive to the NCM nanomaterial, a thicker graphene coating may\\nbe created around the NCM particles and consequently, more\\neffective protection against the generation of SEI layer is provided,\\nand the capacity loss decreases.\\nThe RGO-containing cells were subjected to cyclic charge/\\ndischarge tests at the current rates 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 3C, and\\n5C (5 cycles at each rate) in the voltage range 2.5e4.3 V. For com-\\nparison, the discharge capacity of the different samples at the rate\\nof 0.05C was marked on the diagram. As expected, the capacity\\ndecreases at higher C rates. As shown inFig. 7, it is evident that\\nadding graphene to the NCM cathode has a considerable inﬂuence\\non increasing the discharge capacity and decreasing the lost ca-\\npacity at higher C rates. The sample NR5 with 5 wt % RGO exhibits\\nthe best rate capability among other samples. The discharge ca-\\npacity of NR0, NR1, NR3, and NR5 samples at the rate of 0.1C in the\\nﬁrst cycle were measured to be 155.3, 154.6, 166.5, and 175 mAh/g,\\nrespectively. The pristine NCM shows a considerable loss in ca-\\npacity at high C rates, whereas the samples with enough graphene\\ncontent have a lower loss. For example, the capacities of 45.5, 47.0,\\n75.4, and 95.4 mAh/g were obtained at 5C for the samples NR0,\\nNR1, NR3, and NR5, respectively. After testing at a 5C rate, all\\nsamples were re-cycled at 0.1C to check the capability of the bat-\\nteries in retaining their electrochemical performances. The capacity\\nretentions for NR0, NR1, NR3 and NR5 samples were calculated to\\nbe 94.7, 97.5, 98.5 and 99.6%, respectively, clarifying the useful role\\nFig. 3.

It seems that\\nadding graphene sheets to the NCM can prevent unwanted re-\\nactions in the cathode electrodes, increase the diffusion pathways\\nof Li ions, and improve the ion transfer rate, ultimately leading to\\nthe capacity retention of the battery during the cyclic performance.\\nAlso, since graphene sheets wrapped around NCM nanoparticles\\nhave high conductivity and high charge mobility, electrons can be\\ntransferred more quickly at higher discharge rates.\\nIn Fig. 8, cyclabilities of the different samples at the current rate\\nof 1C are compared.

The EIS spectra of NR0, NR1, NR3, and NR5\\nsamples measured after theﬁrst charge-discharge cycle at 0.1C rate\\nare depicted inFig. 9. The intercepts of the curves at real impedance\\n(Z’) axis at high frequency is attributed to the lithium-ion transfer\\nthrough the electrolyte and SEI layer (Rs). Also, the proﬁles of all\\nsamples show a semicircle at middle frequencies and a straight line\\nat lower frequencies. The semicircle located in the middle-\\nfrequency region is attributed to the charge transfer resistance\\n(Rct), and the line in the low-frequency region corresponds to the\\nlithium diffusion within the electrode which de ﬁnes Warburg\\nimpedance [40,46]. The cathode impedance is mainly assigned to\\nthe charge transfer contribution.

It is clear that wrapping the NCM par-\\nticles by highly conductive RGO sheets signiﬁcantly reduces the\\ncharge transfer resistance. Furthermore, the lithium-ion diffusion\\ncoefﬁcient (D) could be obtained from the Warburg line at low\\nfrequencies according to the following equation [46,47]:\\nD ¼ R2T2\\n2A2n4F4C2s2 (1)\\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol.K),T is the absolute tem-\\nperature (298 K),A is the cathode surface area (1.539 cm2), n is the\\nnumber of electrons involved in reaction (n ¼ 1), F is the Faraday\\nconstant (96485.3C/mol), C is the concentration of Li ions in the\\nelectrode (7.1/C2 10/C0 3 mol/cm3) ands is the Warburg factor, which\\ncan be calculated using its relation with frequency (u) as follows\\n[47]:\\nZ’ ¼Rs þ Rct þ su/C0 1=2 (2)\\nWhen Z’ is plotted versusu/C0 1=2 in the low-frequency region, a\\nstraight line is obtained whose slope gives the Warburg factor (s).\\nThe diffusion coefﬁcient of Li ions is yielded by Eq.(1) using the\\nobtained s.

Graphene\\n(and its hybrids) in graphene-based Li batteries usually functions as\\nthe material support, material mediator, electrode framework, or\\nelectrode modiﬁer [23]. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) due to its\\nexcellent electrical conductivity and high surface area has the po-\\ntential for use in Li-ion batteries. In this regard, the LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/\\n3O2e10 wt% graphene composite was prepared by the ball-milling\\nprocess, and the discharge capacity for NCM and NCMeRGO com-\\nposite was obtained as 174.6 and 185.3 mAh/g, respectively [24].\\nThe improvement in the electrochemical properties of a battery\\ncontaining the NCMeRGO composite is attributed to the decrease\\nin the pathway of lithium ions, the enhancement of the electron\\ntransfer rate, and the creation of the electrochemically active sites\\nfor intercalation of lithium ions [ 24,25]. Using the graphene\\nnetwork along with NCM material as a cathode material in the LIBs\\nhas improved the capacity, rate capability, and the cyclic stability of\\nthe battery [26].\\nThe combination of the NCM nanoparticles synthesized by the\\nsolution combustion route and graphene sheets produced from the\\nmicrowave reduction of graphene oxide (GO) is the novel goal of\\nthe present study. Furthermore, the effects of microwave-prepared\\ngraphene as a conductive additive on the electrochemical perfor-\\nmance of the Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 cathode are also investigated.\\n2. Experimental\\nGraphene oxide (GO) aqueous suspension was prepared from\\ngraphite powder using the modi ﬁed Hummers’method. Flake\\ngraphite (1 g) and KMnO4 (3 g) were added to the mixture of H2SO4\\nand H3PO4 and vigorously stirred for a few days. Next, the reaction\\nmixture was poured onto the corresponding amount of H2O2 (30%)\\nand ice. The yellow product was frequently leached and washed by\\nthe hydrochloric acid and deionized water during centrifugation.\\nThe resultant brown GO dispersion was achieved, which was stable\\nfor more than 6 months. The GO suspension was centrifuged at\\n10,000 rpm for 1 h and dried at 80/C14 C for 1 h. The GO paste was then\\nexposed to the microwave irradiation for 10 s to produce reduced\\ngraphene oxide (RGO)ﬂakes.\\nThe layered LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM) was prepared based on\\nour previous report [27]. Concisely, stoichiometric amounts of\\ninitial precursors including nickel nitrate (Merck, 99%), manganese\\nnitrate (Merck, 99%), cobalt nitrate (Merck, 99%), and lithium ni-\\ntrate (Acros, 99%) were dissolved in the deionized water to form a\\nstable solution. The mixture was stirred for 2 h. To ignite the so-\\nlution, urea (Sinchem, 99%) as the fuel was added to the nitrate\\nsolution and stirred for 3 h. Then, the temperature of the solution\\nwas increased to 180 /C14 C to start the combustion process. The\\ncollected powder was calcined at 850/C14 C for 15 h. The combustion\\nreaction is given below:\\nLiNO3 þ 0.33 Ni(NO3)2.6H2O þ 0.33 Co(NO3)2.6H2O þ 0.33\\nMn(NO3)2.4H2O þ 2.33 CO(NH2)2 ¼ LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 þ 3.82\\nN2 þ 10H2O þ2.33 CO2\\nDifferent fractions of RGO (1, 3 and 5 wt %) were used to fabri-\\ncate the NCMeRGO composite. The composite was in-situ prepared\\nduring cathode preparation. To fabricate the cathode electrode,\\npolyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF, 10 wt %) was dissolved in N-Methyl-\\n2-pyrrolidone (NMP) using a magnetic stirrer. RGO was separately\\ndispersed in the NMP for 2 h to obtain a uniform distribution. The\\nsynthesized NCM powder was next added to form the NCMeRGO\\nsuspension by stirring at 1000 rpm followed by a severe sonicat-\\nion for 1 h. Subsequently, the PVDF solution was added to the\\nNCMeRGO suspension under continuous magnetic stirring for\\n30 min. Finally, 3e4 wt. % carbon black was added to the slurry, and\\nthe whole mixture was stirred for 2 h. The slurry was coated on an\\naluminum foil by a tape casting machine. The obtained coating was\\ndried in an oven at 100/C14 C for 3 h. The NCM cathode samples\\ncontaining 0, 1, 3, and 5 wt % RGO additive are called NR0, NR1, NR3,\\nand NR5, respectively.\\nThe electrochemical performances of the as-prepared cathode\\nmaterials were measured for coin-type cells (CR2032). The coin\\ncells were assembled in an argon-ﬁlled glove box with less than\\n1 ppm oxygen and water, using lithium metal as the counter/\\nreference electrode. Also, a Celgard 2400 polypropylene membrane\\nwas used as the battery separator. The electrolyte used in the coin\\ncell was a solution of 1 M LiPF6 in a 1:1 mixture of ethylene car-\\nbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The electrochemical per-\\nformance of the assembled cell was assessed using a battery tester\\nin the range of 2.5e4.3 V. Using an OFG500 OrigaFlex instrument,\\nelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ESI) was carried out in\\nthe frequency range of 100 kHze10 mHz by applying 5 mV AC\\nvoltage. The crystal structure of the samples was checked by X-ray\\npowder diffraction (XRD, Philips PW 1730) with Cu-Ka radiation\\n(l ¼ 0.15406 nm). Field emission scanning electron microscope\\n(FESEM, TESCAN MIRA3) and transmission electron microscope\\n(TEM, EM208S Philips 100 kV) were used to study the morphology\\nand microstructure of the materials. UVeVis spectroscopy mea-\\nsurements were performed on the graphene nanosheets using a\\nShimadzu UV1700 UVeVis spectrometer.\\n3. Results and discussion\\nThe cathode material with a chemical formula of LiNi1/3Co1/\\n3Mn1/3O2 was synthesized by the solution combustion followed by\\nthe calcination at 850/C14 C for 15 h, as mentioned above. The XRD\\npattern of the NCM after the calcination process is shown inFig. 1.\\nThe well-known hexagonal structure of the NCM with its principal\\ncrystallographic planes of (003) and (104) is detected. There are\\napparent splits between (006)e(102) and (108)e(110) doublets,\\nindicating the formation of an excellent layered structure [28e30].\\nFurthermore, the XRD intensity ratioI(003)/I(104) of the material,\\nwhich should be larger than 1.2 to have a small cation mixing and\\nshow an acceptable battery performance [30e32], was calculated\\nto be 1.36. Another measure for evaluating the excellence of the\\nmaterial structure is the ratio of hexagonal lattice parameters (c/a)\\nwhich should be larger than 4.899 to show a more layered crystal\\nstructure and favors the intercalation process [27]. The values ofa,\\nc, andc/a ratio for the synthesized NCM material were calculated to\\nbe 2.868 Å, 14.233 Å, and 4.963, respectively, indicating the\\nFig. 1.

It seems that\\nadding graphene sheets to the NCM can prevent unwanted re-\\nactions in the cathode electrodes, increase the diffusion pathways\\nof Li ions, and improve the ion transfer rate, ultimately leading to\\nthe capacity retention of the battery during the cyclic performance.\\nAlso, since graphene sheets wrapped around NCM nanoparticles\\nhave high conductivity and high charge mobility, electrons can be\\ntransferred more quickly at higher discharge rates.\\nIn Fig. 8, cyclabilities of the different samples at the current rate\\nof 1C are compared. The pristine NCM (NR0) exhibits the discharge\\ncapacity of ~123 mAh/g in theﬁrst cycle, and after 50 charge-\\ndischarge cycles, its capacity reaches 108 mAh/g, implying 12.0%\\ncapacity loss. This loss may be due to the reaction between cathode\\nparticles and electrolyte, leading to reduce capacity retention dur-\\ning the cyclic performance [45].

A more detailed discussion\\non the structural speciﬁcations of the produced NCM has been\\nprovided in our previous paper [27]. Therefore, the NCM synthe-\\nsized is expected to have a microstructure with a higher lattice\\nordering and appropriate electrochemical behavior.\\nFig. 2displays the SEM micrographs of the NCM synthesized by\\nthe combustion route at different magniﬁcations. A uniform dis-\\ntribution of the particle size with no signiﬁcant agglomeration is\\nclearly observed inFig. 2 (a). The NCM particles were obtained with\\na narrow size range of 200e300 nm and faceted morphology, as\\nshown in Fig. 2 (b). The shapes of the particles are like regular\\npolyhedrons with smooth surfaces, implying high crystallinity of\\nthe material [33].\\nThe graphene-based materials synthesized by the chemical\\nexfoliation were evaluated. The X-ray diffraction patterns of GO and\\nRGO are shown in Fig. 3. The full conversion of GO to RGO is\\ndetected through disappearance of the characteristic XRD peak of\\nGO located at 2q z 10/C14 (Fig. 3 (a)) and appearance of the charac-\\nteristic XRD peak of RGO located at 2q z 25/C14 (Fig. 3 (b)), implying\\nthe full reduction of graphene oxide [34,35]. Fig. 3(c) and (d) show\\nthe Raman spectra of GO and RGO. Two characteristic vibration\\nbands of D and G are observed in the range of 1000e2000 cm/C0 1.\\nThe G band, which corresponds to theﬁrst-order of the E2g pho-\\nnons of the sp2 carbon atoms, locates at 1588 and 1592 cm/C0 1 for GO\\nand RGO, respectively. The D band, which is caused by breathing\\nmode ofk-point photons of A1g symmetry and corresponds to the\\nsp3-hybridized carbon atoms, defects, disordering and edges, lo-\\ncates at 1357 and 1361 cm/C0 1 for GO and RGO, respectively [36,37].\\nAfter the reduction process, the intensity ratio of D band to G band\\n(ID/IG) was considerably increased from 0.85 for GO to 1.02 for RGO.\\nSince D band results from sp2 carbon clusters, higher intensity of D\\nband can be attributed to the creation of a large number of small-\\nsized graphene domains and removal of oxygenated species\\n[36,37].\\nUV-Vis absorbance spectra of the graphene oxide (GO) nano-\\nsheets and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) are shown inFig. 04.A s\\ncan be observed, GO indicates two characteristic UV-Vis absorption\\npeaks. The main one centered at 228 nm is assigned topep*\\ntransition of the C¼C bonds and the weak shoulder located at\\n300 nm corresponds to nep* transition of the C¼O bonds [33]. The\\nreduction of GO, which has a highly defective surface with a dis-\\nrupted sp 2-network, restores the p-network, consequently\\nproviding more conductivity and absorption properties. By\\nreducing the graphene oxide using the microwave irradiation, the\\n228 nm peak red-shifted to about 260 nm due to the restoration of\\nthe p-conjugated structure of the graphene sheet [22,23,26,36,38].\\nOn the other hand, the 300 nm shoulder disappeared, conﬁrming\\nthe removal of the oxygenated functional groups and completion of\\nthe reduction process [38].\\nFig. 5 shows the micrographs of the graphene nanosheets and\\nNCMeRGO nanocomposite. SEM image from synthesized RGO in\\nFig. 5 (a) indicates thin carbon sheets, which have a relatively\\naggregated structure with wrinkled surfaces and folding. The TEM\\nimage inFig. 5 (b)shows a graphene sheet supported on the TEM\\nholder. This image was taken after the sonication and dispersion of\\nthe graphene sheets in water. The sheet with folding edges has a\\n1e2 mm lateral size.Fig. 5(c) and (d) depict the TEM micrographs of\\nthe NCMeRGO composite in which the transparent RGO sheets are\\nwrapped around either an individual NCM nanoparticle or a bunch\\nof oxide particles. Cathodes with higher surface areas take advan-\\ntage of reducing the lithium-ion diffusion pathway and improving\\nthe contact between the electrode and electrolyte [39]. Establishing\\nthe connection between NCM particles and RGO nanosheets is the\\nmain reason for obtaining high capacity, better cycling stability, and\\nrate capability. The better the connection between the NCM\\nnanoparticles and RGO is, the higher the electrical conductivity of\\nthe cathode material will be [18]. Fig. 5(c) and (d) indicate ultra-\\nsonic treatment during processing causes the NCM nanoparticles to\\nbe wrapped up by thin RGO nanosheets, forming a core-shell-like\\nstructure.\\nAs mentioned above, the RGO was added to the NCM at 0, 1, 3,\\nand 5 wt % to fabricate a composite LIB cathode.Fig. 6displays the\\ninitial charge-discharge curves for NR0, NR1, NR3, and NR5 samples\\nin the range of 2.5e4.3 V at 0.05C rate. The initial charge and\\ndischarge capacity values for all samples are tabulated inTable 1.A s\\ncan be seen, the sample NR5 with the charge and discharge ca-\\npacities of 209.2 and 186.6 mAh/g, respectively, exhibits the best\\ncapacity values so that its initial discharge capacity is about 11%\\nhigher than that of pristine NCM cathode without graphene (NR0).\\nThis result is strictly comparable with the results reported by Li\\net al. [1]. They synthesized LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 by a facile wet\\nchemical route and prepared a nanocomposite containing\\nNCMe10 wt % RGO with the discharge capacity of 196 mAh/g. A\\nmesoporous graphene (4 wt %) modiﬁed NCM cathode was also\\nrecently fabricated [ 40], and the measurement of the initial\\ndischarge capacity indicated a low value of ~130 mAh/g at a small\\ncurrent density of 50 mA/g in the voltage range of 2.5e4.1 V. The\\nmajor roles of the graphene in the enhancement of the battery\\ncapacity is as follows: (1) RGO with its good conductivity facilitates\\nthe fast electron transport to the current collector.

The EIS spectra of NR0, NR1, NR3, and NR5\\nsamples measured after theﬁrst charge-discharge cycle at 0.1C rate\\nare depicted inFig. 9. The intercepts of the curves at real impedance\\n(Z’) axis at high frequency is attributed to the lithium-ion transfer\\nthrough the electrolyte and SEI layer (Rs). Also, the proﬁles of all\\nsamples show a semicircle at middle frequencies and a straight line\\nat lower frequencies. The semicircle located in the middle-\\nfrequency region is attributed to the charge transfer resistance\\n(Rct), and the line in the low-frequency region corresponds to the\\nlithium diffusion within the electrode which de ﬁnes Warburg\\nimpedance [40,46]. The cathode impedance is mainly assigned to\\nthe charge transfer contribution. The R ct values, which\\napproximately equal to the diameter of semicircles, were calculated\\nto be about 76.88, 58.39, 43.72, and 32.97U for NR0, NR1, NR3, and\\nNR5 samples, respectively. It is clear that wrapping the NCM par-\\nticles by highly conductive RGO sheets signiﬁcantly reduces the\\ncharge transfer resistance. Furthermore, the lithium-ion diffusion\\ncoefﬁcient (D) could be obtained from the Warburg line at low\\nfrequencies according to the following equation [46,47]:\\nD ¼ R2T2\\n2A2n4F4C2s2 (1)\\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol.K),T is the absolute tem-\\nperature (298 K),A is the cathode surface area (1.539 cm2), n is the\\nnumber of electrons involved in reaction (n ¼ 1), F is the Faraday\\nconstant (96485.3C/mol), C is the concentration of Li ions in the\\nelectrode (7.1/C2 10/C0 3 mol/cm3) ands is the Warburg factor, which\\ncan be calculated using its relation with frequency (u) as follows\\n[47]:\\nZ’ ¼Rs þ Rct þ su/C0 1=2 (2)\\nWhen Z’ is plotted versusu/C0 1=2 in the low-frequency region, a\\nstraight line is obtained whose slope gives the Warburg factor (s).\\nThe diffusion coefﬁcient of Li ions is yielded by Eq.(1) using the\\nobtained s.

One of the most important of these technologies is\\nhigh-performance rechargeable batteries. Lithium-ion batteries\\n(LIBs) with high speciﬁc capacity and long cyclic life have been\\ndeveloped for use in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), full electric\\nvehicles (EVs) and electronic devices such as smart cell phones and\\nlaptop computers [1e3].\\nCathode materials with layered structures have received a\\nconsiderable attention in recent years. One of the early instances is\\nLiCoO2 that was widely used as theﬁrst generation of commercial\\nLIBs due to its easy preparation and outstanding cycling stability\\n[4,5]. Various substitutes for cobalt component have been studied\\ndue to the limitations that originate from its safety issues, toxicity,\\nand performance degradation when the battery overcharges [6,7].\\nLithium nickel oxide (LiNiO2) with ana-NaFeO2 structure is another\\ncandidate for use in LIBs [8]. This cathode is cheaper and possesses\\na higher energy density, but lower stability and structural ordering\\nthan LiCoO2 [9]. Moreover, weak capacity reversibility and low\\ncyclic stability are the other disadvantages of LiNiO2. Adding cobalt\\nto LiNiO2 makes it more stable and increases the degree of ordering\\nby decreasing cation mixing [10,11]. Another cathode used in Li-ion\\nbatteries is LiMnO2, which has a layered crystal structure as well\\n[12]. However, the layered LiMnO2 suffers from the structural\\ninstability during electrochemical cycling, and thus, exhibits a\\nsigniﬁcant capacity fading [13,14]. To take advantages of all these\\nmaterials in a combinational design, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM\\nlayered oxide) wasﬁrst prepared in 2001 [15] as a battery material\\nwith a high speciﬁc capacity, low cost, and high safety. NCM ma-\\nterials have been synthesized by various methods including co-\\nprecipitation, sol-gel, solid-state reactions, hydrothermal, micro-\\nemulsion, and solution combustion [16,17]. However, the electro-\\nchemical performance of NCM is limited due to its poor electronic\\nconductivity [17,18].\\nGraphene as a two-dimensional material discovered in 2004 has\\nmany applications in nanotechnology and nanoscience. As an\\nexample, graphene materials have been added to AgInZnS for in-\\nvivo bio-imaging applications [19], CsPbBr3 to enhance the X-ray\\nphoton response [20], and Cu2O nanoparticles to improve the\\nperformance of light-controlled conductive switching [ 21]. To\\nenhance the conductivity of the battery materials including NCM,\\nresearchers have been attempted to reduce their particle size and/* Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: maisam_jalaly@iust.ac.ir (M.
