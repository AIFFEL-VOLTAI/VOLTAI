The NCM particles have a narrow size range of 200-300 nm and exhibit a faceted morphology, resembling regular polyhedrons with smooth surfaces, indicating high crystallinity of the material.",
        "Explanation of TEM results": "The TEM images reveal that the graphene sheets are supported on the TEM holder, showing thin carbon sheets with relatively aggregated structures, wrinkled surfaces, and folding. The graphene sheet has a 1-2 mm lateral size. In the NCMeRGO composite, the TEM micrographs depict transparent RGO sheets wrapped around either individual NCM nanoparticles or a bunch of oxide particles, forming a core-shell-like structure."
