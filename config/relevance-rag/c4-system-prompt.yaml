  guide: Guide for extracting initial discharge capacity based on C-rate
  steps:
    - step 1: Extract all capacities corresponding to different C-rates.
      description: "If the context contains sentences similar to the following patterns, extract the capacity values for all electrodes mentioned. Note that capacity information might be scattered across multiple sentences in the context, so review every sentence carefully."
      patterns:
        - "At ~ C, the discharge capacity is ~ mAh/g."
        - "At ~ C, the initial discharge capacity is ~ mAh/g."
        - "At ~ C, the capacity remains ~ mAh/g."
        - "At ~ C, the capacity decreases to ~ mAh/g."
        - "At higher/lower C-rate (~ C), the discharge capacity is ~ mAh/g."
    - step 2: Extract only the initial discharge capacity.
      description: "Exclude capacity information related to Coulombic efficiency or after cycling."
    - step 3: Extract values for all specified C-rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0).
      description: "For any missing C-rate, set the value to 'None'."
    - step 4: Convert C-rate expressions.
      description: "Convert fractional or alternative formats of C-rate to decimal format (e.g., 1/2C → 0.5C, 1/3C → 0.33C)."
    - step 5: Handle cases where current is given in mA/g instead of C-rate.
      substeps:
        - condition: "If the Ni ratio in NCM is x ≤ 0.7, the theoretical capacity is 180 mAh/g."
        - condition: "If the Ni ratio in NCM is x > 0.7, the theoretical capacity is 200 mAh/g."
        - formula: "Convert mA/g to C-rate using the formula: C-rate = mA/g ÷ theoretical capacity."
