From Figure 3C, the O 1 s spec-\\ntrum of two main peaks are located at the 528.9 and\\n531.5 eV attributed to the oxygen anions and CO2/C0\\n3 group\\nof Li2CO3.\\n23 In the case of the former O 1 s peak, the peak\\nintensity of M-NCM is considerably lower compared to\\nthat of the pristine NCM. It indicates that strong bonding\\nstrength of Mg-O enhances structural stability as well as\\nleads to rapid electron and lithium-ion kinetics.24 In the\\nlatter O 1 s peak, it can be observed that the Li2CO3\\nimpurities are relatively reduced by the generation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer, which is consistent with C 1 s. Fur-\\nthermore, we can observe that the valley between the\\ntwo main peaks of O 1 s, locating at 531.3 eV, is filled\\nafter the MgHPO4 coating process, demonstrating the\\npresence of Li3PO4 coating layer.23\\nFigure 4A depicts initial charge/discharge curves of\\nthe pristine NCM and M-NCM in voltage range of 3.0 to\\n4.3 V at 0.1 C (1 C= 202 mAh g/C0 1) in coin-type half cells.\\nBoth samples show typical charge/discharge profiles of\\nNCM cathode materials without additional plateau and\\npolarization.25 We suggest that the modification process\\nof Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating does not interfere with\\nthe electrochemical reaction. In addition, there is negligi-\\nble variation in discharge capacity between the pristine\\nNCM and M-NCM. Furthermore, M-NCM cathode shows\\nslightly superior discharge capacity of 203.5 mAh g/C0 1\\nthan that of the pristine NCM (199.1 mAh g/C0 1). Also, the\\ninitial coulombic efficiency of the M-NCM (86.1%)\\nexhibits slightly greater value than that of the pristine\\nNCM (85.5%). Figure 4B,C shows the charge-discharge\\ncurves of the pristine NCM and M-NCM with different C-\\nrates, respectively. The C-rates of M-NCM vary from 0.1\\nto 5.0 C. The discharge capacities of M-NCM reduce from\\n203.4 to 180.0 mAh g/C0 1. However, the discharge capaci-\\nties of the pristine NCM is as low as 159.0 mAh g/C0 1 at\\n5.0 C, since it suffer from severe capacity decay due to\\nlarge polarization. In the case of the pristine NCM, the\\nexistence of residual lithium compounds at the cathode\\nsurface induces the low ionic conductivity of LiOH and\\nLi2CO3 as well as leads the cathode particles to separate\\nfrom each other. On the other hand, the formation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer decreases lithium residues during\\nheating process (Equations (1) to (3)) and contributes to\\nthe superior rate capability due to its high Li ionic con-\\nductivity (≈ 10/C0 6 Sm /C0 1).15 Such improvement in electro-\\nchemical behavior is likely due to surface modification of\\nMgHPO4 on the NCM sample.\\nFigure 5 displays rate capability of the pristine NCM\\nand M-NCM at various C-rates (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0\\nC) from 3.0 to 4.3 V. At low C-rates (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 C), the\\nspecific capacity of M-NCM shows somewhat higher than\\nthat of pristine NCM. However, for high rates of 4.0 and\\n6.0 C, the pristine NCM undergoes abrupt capacity fading\\n(169.8 and 151.3 mAh g/C0 1), maintaining inferior capacity\\nretention of 84.7% and 75.5%, respectively. This may be\\ndue to the interfacial unwanted reaction with electrolyte\\nat the interface, which leads to structural degradation,\\nincreased impedance, and electrolyte erosion of the pris-\\ntine NCM.26 However, the M-NCM retains a good dis-\\ncharge capacity of 168.9 mAh g /C0 1 at 6 C, revealing\\nsuperior electrochemical reversibility with the retention\\nof 82.0%.27 It can be explained by concurrent doping and\\nFIGURE 2 FE-SEM and TEM images of (A), (C) pristine NCM, (B), (D) M-NCM.

LiF þPF5 ð4Þ\\nPF5 þH2O ! POF3 þ2HF ð5Þ\\nPOF3 þLi2O ! 6LiF þP2O5 or LixPOFy\\n/C0/C1\\nð6Þ\\nBased on the above-mentioned Equations (4)–(6), the\\ngenerated hydrofluoric acid (HF) attacks the NCM cath-\\node, dissolving transition metal atoms from the particle\\nsurface, thereby finally leading to structural decay and\\nlarge capacity drop.15 Moreover, the electronic insulating\\nLiF increases the resistance of cell, leading to the genera-\\ntion and growth of SEI layer.34 Thus, the introduction of\\nMgHPO4 simultaneously mainly provides two com-\\nbined advantages of Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating for\\nenhanced electrochemical performances. (i) Due to the\\nstrong bond strength of Mg II/C0 O compared to that of\\nNiIII/C0 O, Mg substitution into the NCM lattice structure\\ncan serve superior structural stability during cycling.35\\nThe existence of Mg in the lithium layer, as a pillar ion,\\nnot only minimizes abrupt contraction along the\\ncdirection, suppressing the cathode volume change, but\\nalso reduces the undesirable cation disorder, as men-\\ntioned in Table 1.36,37 (ii) The Li 3PO4 coating layer,\\nformed at the cathode surface, could act as a scavenger of\\nHF and residual water, according to the following\\nEquations38:\\nLi3PO4 þH2O ¼ LixHyPO4 or POxHy\\n/C0/C1\\nþLi2O ð7Þ\\nLi3PO4 þHF ¼ LixHyPO4 or POxHy\\n/C0/C1\\nþLiF ð8Þ\\nParticularly, the Li3PO4-modified layer can eliminate\\nlithium impurities (Li2O, LiOH, Li2CO3, etc.) on the cath-\\node surface of NCM material through formation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer via Equations (1) to (3). In addition,\\nLi3PO4 coating layer keeps cathode surface from direct\\ncontact with electrolyte and finally reducing the interfa-\\ncial unwanted reactions at the electrode/electrolyte inter-\\nface and microcracking.39 At a high C-rate of 1.0 C\\n(Figure 6B), it was confirmed that the difference in the\\ncapacity values of both samples becomes larger after\\n100 cycles. The discharge capacity of M-NCM is 143.6\\nmAh g/C0 1, whereas the pristine NCM shows only 103.3\\nmAh g/C0 1 during the same cycling period. The difference\\nindicates that superior surface chemistry, stabilized by\\nsurface modification can play an important role in facili-\\ntating smooth and rapid intercalation kinetics with inher-\\nent structural stability. Figure 6C reveals the cycle\\nperformances of pristine NCM/graphite and M-NCM/\\ngraphite full cells at 25/C14 C. As profiled, the pristine\\nNCM/graphite full-cell undergoes severe capacity fading\\nwith a capacity retention of 65.1% after 300 cycles, which\\nis ascribed from cathode degradation. However, the M-\\nNCM/graphite full-cell obviously maintains better capac-\\nity retention of 79.8% with a higher coulombic efficiency\\nof nearly 99.7%. Therefore, we can conclude that the\\ndual-modified NCM sample, utilizing the respective func-\\ntions of Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating, exhibits superior\\ncycling performance based on structural stability. It is\\nalso driven from reducing irreversible parasitic reaction\\nat interface and minimizing the Li residues and HF\\nattacks.\\nTo study the influence of MgHPO4 modification on\\ninterfacial resistance, we performed EIS test with equiva-\\nlent circuit model (Figure7A) after 1 st and 100th cycles.\\nAs Figure7B,C shows, the Nyquist curves of the pristine\\nNCM and M-NCM display a similar outline with the\\nFIGURE 6 Cycle performance of pristine NCM and M-NCM at C-rates of (A) 0.5 and (B) 1.0 C.

LiF þPF5 ð4Þ\\nPF5 þH2O ! POF3 þ2HF ð5Þ\\nPOF3 þLi2O ! 6LiF þP2O5 or LixPOFy\\n/C0/C1\\nð6Þ\\nBased on the above-mentioned Equations (4)–(6), the\\ngenerated hydrofluoric acid (HF) attacks the NCM cath-\\node, dissolving transition metal atoms from the particle\\nsurface, thereby finally leading to structural decay and\\nlarge capacity drop.15 Moreover, the electronic insulating\\nLiF increases the resistance of cell, leading to the genera-\\ntion and growth of SEI layer.34 Thus, the introduction of\\nMgHPO4 simultaneously mainly provides two com-\\nbined advantages of Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating for\\nenhanced electrochemical performances. (i) Due to the\\nstrong bond strength of Mg II/C0 O compared to that of\\nNiIII/C0 O, Mg substitution into the NCM lattice structure\\ncan serve superior structural stability during cycling.35\\nThe existence of Mg in the lithium layer, as a pillar ion,\\nnot only minimizes abrupt contraction along the\\ncdirection, suppressing the cathode volume change, but\\nalso reduces the undesirable cation disorder, as men-\\ntioned in Table 1.36,37 (ii) The Li 3PO4 coating layer,\\nformed at the cathode surface, could act as a scavenger of\\nHF and residual water, according to the following\\nEquations38:\\nLi3PO4 þH2O ¼ LixHyPO4 or POxHy\\n/C0/C1\\nþLi2O ð7Þ\\nLi3PO4 þHF ¼ LixHyPO4 or POxHy\\n/C0/C1\\nþLiF ð8Þ\\nParticularly, the Li3PO4-modified layer can eliminate\\nlithium impurities (Li2O, LiOH, Li2CO3, etc.) on the cath-\\node surface of NCM material through formation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer via Equations (1) to (3). In addition,\\nLi3PO4 coating layer keeps cathode surface from direct\\ncontact with electrolyte and finally reducing the interfa-\\ncial unwanted reactions at the electrode/electrolyte inter-\\nface and microcracking.39 At a high C-rate of 1.0 C\\n(Figure 6B), it was confirmed that the difference in the\\ncapacity values of both samples becomes larger after\\n100 cycles. The discharge capacity of M-NCM is 143.6\\nmAh g/C0 1, whereas the pristine NCM shows only 103.3\\nmAh g/C0 1 during the same cycling period. The difference\\nindicates that superior surface chemistry, stabilized by\\nsurface modification can play an important role in facili-\\ntating smooth and rapid intercalation kinetics with inher-\\nent structural stability. Figure 6C reveals the cycle\\nperformances of pristine NCM/graphite and M-NCM/\\ngraphite full cells at 25/C14 C. As profiled, the pristine\\nNCM/graphite full-cell undergoes severe capacity fading\\nwith a capacity retention of 65.1% after 300 cycles, which\\nis ascribed from cathode degradation. However, the M-\\nNCM/graphite full-cell obviously maintains better capac-\\nity retention of 79.8% with a higher coulombic efficiency\\nof nearly 99.7%. Therefore, we can conclude that the\\ndual-modified NCM sample, utilizing the respective func-\\ntions of Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating, exhibits superior\\ncycling performance based on structural stability. It is\\nalso driven from reducing irreversible parasitic reaction\\nat interface and minimizing the Li residues and HF\\nattacks.\\nTo study the influence of MgHPO4 modification on\\ninterfacial resistance, we performed EIS test with equiva-\\nlent circuit model (Figure7A) after 1 st and 100th cycles.\\nAs Figure7B,C shows, the Nyquist curves of the pristine\\nNCM and M-NCM display a similar outline with the\\nFIGURE 6 Cycle performance of pristine NCM and M-NCM at C-rates of (A) 0.5 and (B) 1.0 C.

The semicircle\\nnow appears as a combination of two semicircles.40 As\\nsuch, the one at the high-frequency region refers to the\\nresistance of the SEI layer (RSEI) and the other at the\\nmiddle-frequency region corresponds to the charge-\\ntransfer resistance ( Rct). The oblique line at the low-\\nfrequency region represents the Warburg impedance\\n(W).1,41-43 As listed in Table3, it can be noted the pris-\\ntine NCM undergoes significantly increased Rct from\\n28.3 to 41.2 Ω. In contrast, for M-NCM, Rct value is\\nrelatively less increased (from 22.8 to 26.2Ω), demon-\\nstrating that the MgHPO 4 modification protects the\\nactive material from catalytic side reactions at the cath-\\node/electrolyte interface during cycling process. 4 The\\ndiffusion coefficient of lithium ions (DLi+)i sm e a s u r e d\\nto investigate the influence of the MgHPO4 modifica-\\ntion on the reaction kinetics, which can be calculated\\nby the following Equations44:\\nDLiþ ¼ R2T2=2n4F4A2σ2c2 ð9Þ\\nZ0 ¼ Rct þRe þσω/C0 0:5 ð10Þ\\nFrom equations, R and T refer the gas constant and\\nabsolute temperature, respectively, n is the number of\\nelectrons transferred, F is the faraday constant, A is the\\nelectrode plate area between electrode/electrolyte,σ is\\nthe Warburg factor, and c is the insertion/extraction Li+\\nions concentration. Theσ value can be obtained from the\\nslope of the lines between Z0 and σ/C0 0.5. In particular, the\\nobtained DLi+ of the pristine NCM and M-NCM are\\n2.15 /C2 10/C0 11 cm2 s/C0 1 and 8.21 /C2 10/C0 11 cm2 s/C0 1, respec-\\ntively, as summarized in Table3. The higher DLi+ value of\\nM-NCM depends on providing more transport passages of\\nlithium-ion than those of the pristine sample during the\\ncharge/discharge process. Consequently, the dual-\\nmodified MgHPO4 modification on the NCM cathode can\\neffectively enhance the electrochemical properties by\\ndecreasing cell impedance and facilitating rapid and\\nsmooth lithium-ion movement.45\\nTo further compare the different electrochemical\\nbehaviors of both samples, the cyclic voltammetry\\n(CV) results are performed after 1 st cycle at a scan rate\\nof 0.1 mV s/C0 1, as shown in Figure8A. From CV plots, the\\nredox peaks of the pristine NCM and N-NCM are\\ndetected at approximately 3.73 and 4.25 V corresponding\\nto Ni2+/Ni4+ and Co3+/Co4+, respectively.20,44 As illus-\\ntrated in CV plots, surface modification by MgHPO4 does\\nnot affect the crystal structure of NCM cathode. Also, we\\ncan observe that the M-NCM exhibits the lower potential\\ndifference of redox couple (0.071 V) than that of the pris-\\ntine NCM (0.132 V). It can be explained that MgHPO4 is\\nbeneficial for fast Li-ion transport and improved revers-\\nibility.10 The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)\\nmeasurements for electrochemically delithiated cathodes\\nare investigated to compare the thermal stabilities of the\\npristine NCM and M-NCM. As shown in Figure8B, the\\nexothermic peak of pristine NCM is detected at 222.1/C14 C\\nwith the heat generation of 2423 J g/C0 1, while the exother-\\nmic peak of M-NCM is obviously shifted to an increased\\ntemperature of 239.0/C14 C with reduced heat generation of\\n1837 J g/C0 1.46-49 Once again, such results highlight that\\nsynergistic coupling effects of Mg-doping and Li 3PO4-\\ncoating are advantageous to delay the onset temperature,\\nimproving the thermal stability of Ni-rich NCM\\nmaterials.34,50-53\\nTo further confirm the structural evolution of the\\npristine NCM and M-NCM, we observe the particle mor-\\nphology using FE-SEM after 100 electrochemical cycles.\\nFIGURE 7 EIS analysis with (A) equivalent circuit model and Nyquist plots of pristine NCM and M-NCM after (B) 1 st cycle and\\n(C) 100th cycles\\nTABLE 3 Rct and DLi+ of pristine NCM and M-NCM\\nSample Rct [Ω cm/C0 2] DLi+ [cm2 s/C0 1]\\nBefore cycle After cycle\\nPristine NCM 28.3 41.2 2.15 /C2 10/C0 11\\nM-NCM 22.8 26.2 8.21 /C2 10/C0 11\\n15250 HWANG ET AL.\\n 1099114x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.8222 by Chung-Ang University, Wiley Online Library on [26/12/2024].

From Figure 3C, the O 1 s spec-\\ntrum of two main peaks are located at the 528.9 and\\n531.5 eV attributed to the oxygen anions and CO2/C0\\n3 group\\nof Li2CO3.\\n23 In the case of the former O 1 s peak, the peak\\nintensity of M-NCM is considerably lower compared to\\nthat of the pristine NCM. It indicates that strong bonding\\nstrength of Mg-O enhances structural stability as well as\\nleads to rapid electron and lithium-ion kinetics.24 In the\\nlatter O 1 s peak, it can be observed that the Li2CO3\\nimpurities are relatively reduced by the generation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer, which is consistent with C 1 s. Fur-\\nthermore, we can observe that the valley between the\\ntwo main peaks of O 1 s, locating at 531.3 eV, is filled\\nafter the MgHPO4 coating process, demonstrating the\\npresence of Li3PO4 coating layer.23\\nFigure 4A depicts initial charge/discharge curves of\\nthe pristine NCM and M-NCM in voltage range of 3.0 to\\n4.3 V at 0.1 C (1 C= 202 mAh g/C0 1) in coin-type half cells.\\nBoth samples show typical charge/discharge profiles of\\nNCM cathode materials without additional plateau and\\npolarization.25 We suggest that the modification process\\nof Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating does not interfere with\\nthe electrochemical reaction. In addition, there is negligi-\\nble variation in discharge capacity between the pristine\\nNCM and M-NCM. Furthermore, M-NCM cathode shows\\nslightly superior discharge capacity of 203.5 mAh g/C0 1\\nthan that of the pristine NCM (199.1 mAh g/C0 1). Also, the\\ninitial coulombic efficiency of the M-NCM (86.1%)\\nexhibits slightly greater value than that of the pristine\\nNCM (85.5%). Figure 4B,C shows the charge-discharge\\ncurves of the pristine NCM and M-NCM with different C-\\nrates, respectively. The C-rates of M-NCM vary from 0.1\\nto 5.0 C. The discharge capacities of M-NCM reduce from\\n203.4 to 180.0 mAh g/C0 1. However, the discharge capaci-\\nties of the pristine NCM is as low as 159.0 mAh g/C0 1 at\\n5.0 C, since it suffer from severe capacity decay due to\\nlarge polarization. In the case of the pristine NCM, the\\nexistence of residual lithium compounds at the cathode\\nsurface induces the low ionic conductivity of LiOH and\\nLi2CO3 as well as leads the cathode particles to separate\\nfrom each other. On the other hand, the formation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer decreases lithium residues during\\nheating process (Equations (1) to (3)) and contributes to\\nthe superior rate capability due to its high Li ionic con-\\nductivity (≈ 10/C0 6 Sm /C0 1).15 Such improvement in electro-\\nchemical behavior is likely due to surface modification of\\nMgHPO4 on the NCM sample.\\nFigure 5 displays rate capability of the pristine NCM\\nand M-NCM at various C-rates (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0\\nC) from 3.0 to 4.3 V. At low C-rates (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 C), the\\nspecific capacity of M-NCM shows somewhat higher than\\nthat of pristine NCM. However, for high rates of 4.0 and\\n6.0 C, the pristine NCM undergoes abrupt capacity fading\\n(169.8 and 151.3 mAh g/C0 1), maintaining inferior capacity\\nretention of 84.7% and 75.5%, respectively. This may be\\ndue to the interfacial unwanted reaction with electrolyte\\nat the interface, which leads to structural degradation,\\nincreased impedance, and electrolyte erosion of the pris-\\ntine NCM.26 However, the M-NCM retains a good dis-\\ncharge capacity of 168.9 mAh g /C0 1 at 6 C, revealing\\nsuperior electrochemical reversibility with the retention\\nof 82.0%.27 It can be explained by concurrent doping and\\nFIGURE 2 FE-SEM and TEM images of (A), (C) pristine NCM, (B), (D) M-NCM.

LiF þPF5 ð4Þ\\nPF5 þH2O ! POF3 þ2HF ð5Þ\\nPOF3 þLi2O ! 6LiF þP2O5 or LixPOFy\\n/C0/C1\\nð6Þ\\nBased on the above-mentioned Equations (4)–(6), the\\ngenerated hydrofluoric acid (HF) attacks the NCM cath-\\node, dissolving transition metal atoms from the particle\\nsurface, thereby finally leading to structural decay and\\nlarge capacity drop.15 Moreover, the electronic insulating\\nLiF increases the resistance of cell, leading to the genera-\\ntion and growth of SEI layer.34 Thus, the introduction of\\nMgHPO4 simultaneously mainly provides two com-\\nbined advantages of Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating for\\nenhanced electrochemical performances. (i) Due to the\\nstrong bond strength of Mg II/C0 O compared to that of\\nNiIII/C0 O, Mg substitution into the NCM lattice structure\\ncan serve superior structural stability during cycling.35\\nThe existence of Mg in the lithium layer, as a pillar ion,\\nnot only minimizes abrupt contraction along the\\ncdirection, suppressing the cathode volume change, but\\nalso reduces the undesirable cation disorder, as men-\\ntioned in Table 1.36,37 (ii) The Li 3PO4 coating layer,\\nformed at the cathode surface, could act as a scavenger of\\nHF and residual water, according to the following\\nEquations38:\\nLi3PO4 þH2O ¼ LixHyPO4 or POxHy\\n/C0/C1\\nþLi2O ð7Þ\\nLi3PO4 þHF ¼ LixHyPO4 or POxHy\\n/C0/C1\\nþLiF ð8Þ\\nParticularly, the Li3PO4-modified layer can eliminate\\nlithium impurities (Li2O, LiOH, Li2CO3, etc.) on the cath-\\node surface of NCM material through formation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer via Equations (1) to (3). In addition,\\nLi3PO4 coating layer keeps cathode surface from direct\\ncontact with electrolyte and finally reducing the interfa-\\ncial unwanted reactions at the electrode/electrolyte inter-\\nface and microcracking.39 At a high C-rate of 1.0 C\\n(Figure 6B), it was confirmed that the difference in the\\ncapacity values of both samples becomes larger after\\n100 cycles. The discharge capacity of M-NCM is 143.6\\nmAh g/C0 1, whereas the pristine NCM shows only 103.3\\nmAh g/C0 1 during the same cycling period. The difference\\nindicates that superior surface chemistry, stabilized by\\nsurface modification can play an important role in facili-\\ntating smooth and rapid intercalation kinetics with inher-\\nent structural stability. Figure 6C reveals the cycle\\nperformances of pristine NCM/graphite and M-NCM/\\ngraphite full cells at 25/C14 C. As profiled, the pristine\\nNCM/graphite full-cell undergoes severe capacity fading\\nwith a capacity retention of 65.1% after 300 cycles, which\\nis ascribed from cathode degradation. However, the M-\\nNCM/graphite full-cell obviously maintains better capac-\\nity retention of 79.8% with a higher coulombic efficiency\\nof nearly 99.7%. Therefore, we can conclude that the\\ndual-modified NCM sample, utilizing the respective func-\\ntions of Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating, exhibits superior\\ncycling performance based on structural stability. It is\\nalso driven from reducing irreversible parasitic reaction\\nat interface and minimizing the Li residues and HF\\nattacks.\\nTo study the influence of MgHPO4 modification on\\ninterfacial resistance, we performed EIS test with equiva-\\nlent circuit model (Figure7A) after 1 st and 100th cycles.\\nAs Figure7B,C shows, the Nyquist curves of the pristine\\nNCM and M-NCM display a similar outline with the\\nFIGURE 6 Cycle performance of pristine NCM and M-NCM at C-rates of (A) 0.5 and (B) 1.0 C.

From Figure 3C, the O 1 s spec-\\ntrum of two main peaks are located at the 528.9 and\\n531.5 eV attributed to the oxygen anions and CO2/C0\\n3 group\\nof Li2CO3.\\n23 In the case of the former O 1 s peak, the peak\\nintensity of M-NCM is considerably lower compared to\\nthat of the pristine NCM. It indicates that strong bonding\\nstrength of Mg-O enhances structural stability as well as\\nleads to rapid electron and lithium-ion kinetics.24 In the\\nlatter O 1 s peak, it can be observed that the Li2CO3\\nimpurities are relatively reduced by the generation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer, which is consistent with C 1 s. Fur-\\nthermore, we can observe that the valley between the\\ntwo main peaks of O 1 s, locating at 531.3 eV, is filled\\nafter the MgHPO4 coating process, demonstrating the\\npresence of Li3PO4 coating layer.23\\nFigure 4A depicts initial charge/discharge curves of\\nthe pristine NCM and M-NCM in voltage range of 3.0 to\\n4.3 V at 0.1 C (1 C= 202 mAh g/C0 1) in coin-type half cells.\\nBoth samples show typical charge/discharge profiles of\\nNCM cathode materials without additional plateau and\\npolarization.25 We suggest that the modification process\\nof Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating does not interfere with\\nthe electrochemical reaction. In addition, there is negligi-\\nble variation in discharge capacity between the pristine\\nNCM and M-NCM. Furthermore, M-NCM cathode shows\\nslightly superior discharge capacity of 203.5 mAh g/C0 1\\nthan that of the pristine NCM (199.1 mAh g/C0 1). Also, the\\ninitial coulombic efficiency of the M-NCM (86.1%)\\nexhibits slightly greater value than that of the pristine\\nNCM (85.5%). Figure 4B,C shows the charge-discharge\\ncurves of the pristine NCM and M-NCM with different C-\\nrates, respectively. The C-rates of M-NCM vary from 0.1\\nto 5.0 C. The discharge capacities of M-NCM reduce from\\n203.4 to 180.0 mAh g/C0 1. However, the discharge capaci-\\nties of the pristine NCM is as low as 159.0 mAh g/C0 1 at\\n5.0 C, since it suffer from severe capacity decay due to\\nlarge polarization. In the case of the pristine NCM, the\\nexistence of residual lithium compounds at the cathode\\nsurface induces the low ionic conductivity of LiOH and\\nLi2CO3 as well as leads the cathode particles to separate\\nfrom each other. On the other hand, the formation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer decreases lithium residues during\\nheating process (Equations (1) to (3)) and contributes to\\nthe superior rate capability due to its high Li ionic con-\\nductivity (≈ 10/C0 6 Sm /C0 1).15 Such improvement in electro-\\nchemical behavior is likely due to surface modification of\\nMgHPO4 on the NCM sample.\\nFigure 5 displays rate capability of the pristine NCM\\nand M-NCM at various C-rates (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0\\nC) from 3.0 to 4.3 V. At low C-rates (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 C), the\\nspecific capacity of M-NCM shows somewhat higher than\\nthat of pristine NCM. However, for high rates of 4.0 and\\n6.0 C, the pristine NCM undergoes abrupt capacity fading\\n(169.8 and 151.3 mAh g/C0 1), maintaining inferior capacity\\nretention of 84.7% and 75.5%, respectively. This may be\\ndue to the interfacial unwanted reaction with electrolyte\\nat the interface, which leads to structural degradation,\\nincreased impedance, and electrolyte erosion of the pris-\\ntine NCM.26 However, the M-NCM retains a good dis-\\ncharge capacity of 168.9 mAh g /C0 1 at 6 C, revealing\\nsuperior electrochemical reversibility with the retention\\nof 82.0%.27 It can be explained by concurrent doping and\\nFIGURE 2 FE-SEM and TEM images of (A), (C) pristine NCM, (B), (D) M-NCM.

LiF þPF5 ð4Þ\\nPF5 þH2O ! POF3 þ2HF ð5Þ\\nPOF3 þLi2O ! 6LiF þP2O5 or LixPOFy\\n/C0/C1\\nð6Þ\\nBased on the above-mentioned Equations (4)–(6), the\\ngenerated hydrofluoric acid (HF) attacks the NCM cath-\\node, dissolving transition metal atoms from the particle\\nsurface, thereby finally leading to structural decay and\\nlarge capacity drop.15 Moreover, the electronic insulating\\nLiF increases the resistance of cell, leading to the genera-\\ntion and growth of SEI layer.34 Thus, the introduction of\\nMgHPO4 simultaneously mainly provides two com-\\nbined advantages of Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating for\\nenhanced electrochemical performances. (i) Due to the\\nstrong bond strength of Mg II/C0 O compared to that of\\nNiIII/C0 O, Mg substitution into the NCM lattice structure\\ncan serve superior structural stability during cycling.35\\nThe existence of Mg in the lithium layer, as a pillar ion,\\nnot only minimizes abrupt contraction along the\\ncdirection, suppressing the cathode volume change, but\\nalso reduces the undesirable cation disorder, as men-\\ntioned in Table 1.36,37 (ii) The Li 3PO4 coating layer,\\nformed at the cathode surface, could act as a scavenger of\\nHF and residual water, according to the following\\nEquations38:\\nLi3PO4 þH2O ¼ LixHyPO4 or POxHy\\n/C0/C1\\nþLi2O ð7Þ\\nLi3PO4 þHF ¼ LixHyPO4 or POxHy\\n/C0/C1\\nþLiF ð8Þ\\nParticularly, the Li3PO4-modified layer can eliminate\\nlithium impurities (Li2O, LiOH, Li2CO3, etc.) on the cath-\\node surface of NCM material through formation of\\nLi3PO4 coating layer via Equations (1) to (3). In addition,\\nLi3PO4 coating layer keeps cathode surface from direct\\ncontact with electrolyte and finally reducing the interfa-\\ncial unwanted reactions at the electrode/electrolyte inter-\\nface and microcracking.39 At a high C-rate of 1.0 C\\n(Figure 6B), it was confirmed that the difference in the\\ncapacity values of both samples becomes larger after\\n100 cycles. The discharge capacity of M-NCM is 143.6\\nmAh g/C0 1, whereas the pristine NCM shows only 103.3\\nmAh g/C0 1 during the same cycling period. The difference\\nindicates that superior surface chemistry, stabilized by\\nsurface modification can play an important role in facili-\\ntating smooth and rapid intercalation kinetics with inher-\\nent structural stability. Figure 6C reveals the cycle\\nperformances of pristine NCM/graphite and M-NCM/\\ngraphite full cells at 25/C14 C. As profiled, the pristine\\nNCM/graphite full-cell undergoes severe capacity fading\\nwith a capacity retention of 65.1% after 300 cycles, which\\nis ascribed from cathode degradation. However, the M-\\nNCM/graphite full-cell obviously maintains better capac-\\nity retention of 79.8% with a higher coulombic efficiency\\nof nearly 99.7%. Therefore, we can conclude that the\\ndual-modified NCM sample, utilizing the respective func-\\ntions of Mg doping and Li3PO4 coating, exhibits superior\\ncycling performance based on structural stability. It is\\nalso driven from reducing irreversible parasitic reaction\\nat interface and minimizing the Li residues and HF\\nattacks.\\nTo study the influence of MgHPO4 modification on\\ninterfacial resistance, we performed EIS test with equiva-\\nlent circuit model (Figure7A) after 1 st and 100th cycles.\\nAs Figure7B,C shows, the Nyquist curves of the pristine\\nNCM and M-NCM display a similar outline with the\\nFIGURE 6 Cycle performance of pristine NCM and M-NCM at C-rates of (A) 0.5 and (B) 1.0 C.

In contrast, for M-NCM, Rct value is\\nrelatively less increased (from 22.8 to 26.2Ω), demon-\\nstrating that the MgHPO 4 modification protects the\\nactive material from catalytic side reactions at the cath-\\node/electrolyte interface during cycling process. 4 The\\ndiffusion coefficient of lithium ions (DLi+)i sm e a s u r e d\\nto investigate the influence of the MgHPO4 modifica-\\ntion on the reaction kinetics, which can be calculated\\nby the following Equations44:\\nDLiþ ¼ R2T2=2n4F4A2σ2c2 ð9Þ\\nZ0 ¼ Rct þRe þσω/C0 0:5 ð10Þ\\nFrom equations, R and T refer the gas constant and\\nabsolute temperature, respectively, n is the number of\\nelectrons transferred, F is the faraday constant, A is the\\nelectrode plate area between electrode/electrolyte,σ is\\nthe Warburg factor, and c is the insertion/extraction Li+\\nions concentration. Theσ value can be obtained from the\\nslope of the lines between Z0 and σ/C0 0.5. In particular, the\\nobtained DLi+ of the pristine NCM and M-NCM are\\n2.15 /C2 10/C0 11 cm2 s/C0 1 and 8.21 /C2 10/C0 11 cm2 s/C0 1, respec-\\ntively, as summarized in Table3. The higher DLi+ value of\\nM-NCM depends on providing more transport passages of\\nlithium-ion than those of the pristine sample during the\\ncharge/discharge process. Consequently, the dual-\\nmodified MgHPO4 modification on the NCM cathode can\\neffectively enhance the electrochemical properties by\\ndecreasing cell impedance and facilitating rapid and\\nsmooth lithium-ion movement.45\\nTo further compare the different electrochemical\\nbehaviors of both samples, the cyclic voltammetry\\n(CV) results are performed after 1 st cycle at a scan rate\\nof 0.1 mV s/C0 1, as shown in Figure8A. From CV plots, the\\nredox peaks of the pristine NCM and N-NCM are\\ndetected at approximately 3.73 and 4.25 V corresponding\\nto Ni2+/Ni4+ and Co3+/Co4+, respectively.20,44 As illus-\\ntrated in CV plots, surface modification by MgHPO4 does\\nnot affect the crystal structure of NCM cathode. Also, we\\ncan observe that the M-NCM exhibits the lower potential\\ndifference of redox couple (0.071 V) than that of the pris-\\ntine NCM (0.132 V). It can be explained that MgHPO4 is\\nbeneficial for fast Li-ion transport and improved revers-\\nibility.10 The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)\\nmeasurements for electrochemically delithiated cathodes\\nare investigated to compare the thermal stabilities of the\\npristine NCM and M-NCM. As shown in Figure8B, the\\nexothermic peak of pristine NCM is detected at 222.1/C14 C\\nwith the heat generation of 2423 J g/C0 1, while the exother-\\nmic peak of M-NCM is obviously shifted to an increased\\ntemperature of 239.0/C14 C with reduced heat generation of\\n1837 J g/C0 1.46-49 Once again, such results highlight that\\nsynergistic coupling effects of Mg-doping and Li 3PO4-\\ncoating are advantageous to delay the onset temperature,\\nimproving the thermal stability of Ni-rich NCM\\nmaterials.34,50-53\\nTo further confirm the structural evolution of the\\npristine NCM and M-NCM, we observe the particle mor-\\nphology using FE-SEM after 100 electrochemical cycles.\\nFIGURE 7 EIS analysis with (A) equivalent circuit model and Nyquist plots of pristine NCM and M-NCM after (B) 1 st cycle and\\n(C) 100th cycles\\nTABLE 3 Rct and DLi+ of pristine NCM and M-NCM\\nSample Rct [Ω cm/C0 2] DLi+ [cm2 s/C0 1]\\nBefore cycle After cycle\\nPristine NCM 28.3 41.2 2.15 /C2 10/C0 11\\nM-NCM 22.8 26.2 8.21 /C2 10/C0 11\\n15250 HWANG ET AL.\\n 1099114x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.8222 by Chung-Ang University, Wiley Online Library on [26/12/2024].
